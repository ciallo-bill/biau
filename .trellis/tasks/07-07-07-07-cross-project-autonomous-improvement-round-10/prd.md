# Cross-project autonomous improvement round 10

## Goal

Continue autonomous local improvements for BIAU Port and related projects, prioritizing public discoverability, status reliability, Studio/AI Daily workflow quality, assistant usability, and project-detail trust evidence while recording cloud, credential, live model, and release gates as manual follow-ups.

## Requirements

- R1. Continue local, verifiable improvements without waiting for user input unless a true manual gate appears.
- R2. Prefer changes that make existing public routes, Studio workflows, assistant behavior, project details, or reliability observations more complete and trustworthy.
- R3. Do not run live model/provider pings, credentialed production checks, paid tasks, cloud dashboard changes, or APK release publication without explicit user approval.
- R4. Record manual gates instead of blocking further local work.
- R5. Keep each child task independently verifiable, small enough to roll back, and backed by project scripts or deterministic checks.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] At least one child task is completed, verified, committed locally, and archived.
- [x] Manual gates are recorded in task notes.
- [x] No secrets, production credentials, private URLs, model relay endpoints, or unapproved APK links are committed.
- [x] Finished child tasks are archived before the parent is archived.

## Initial Task Map

- `status-detail-sitemap`: make `/status/:projectId` detail pages discoverable through sitemap generation and synthetic sitemap checks.
- `assistant-knowledge-v2-verify-gate`: make assistant knowledge graph quality checks part of the normal verification path.

## Results

- Completed and archived `07-07-07-07-round-10-status-detail-sitemap-coverage`.
  - Sitemap generation now includes all `/status/:projectId` detail pages.
  - Main-site synthetic checks and site monitor checks now verify status detail discoverability.
  - Local route-only synthetic checks can skip the assistant API gate with `--skip-assistant-api`.
- Completed and archived `07-07-07-07-round-10-assistant-knowledge-v2-verify-gate`.
  - `npm.cmd run verify` now includes the assistant knowledge graph quality gate.
  - Assistant quality and deployment docs now describe the deterministic check.
  - Backend/frontend quality specs and agent workflow notes were updated so future sessions keep the gate.

## Manual Gates

- GitHub SSH host key verification still blocks pushing local commits.
- Cloudflare, Render, Aiven/Supabase, Prometheus/Grafana/ARMS, Umami/Plausible, Search Console, and scheduled monitors remain platform setup tasks.
- Live model prompts, provider diagnostics, production assistant checks, and AI Daily model-assisted generation remain opt-in real tasks only.
- Legal RAG / ERP / Xunqiu credentialed checks require approved low-privilege demo credentials or production tokens.
- Pet/Xunqiu APK/AAB signing, checksum publication, and public download approval remain release gates.
