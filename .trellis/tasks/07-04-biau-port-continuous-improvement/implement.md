# BIAU Port continuous improvement implementation plan

## Phase 1: Parent Task Setup

- [x] Create parent task.
- [x] Link public assistant frontier RAG task as child.
- [x] Link cross-project release readiness parent task as child.
- [x] Write parent `prd.md`.
- [x] Write parent `design.md`.
- [x] Write parent `implement.md`.
- [x] Write parent `manual-actions.md`.
- [x] Run `git diff --check`.
- [x] Report the task tree and manual-action queue to the user.

## Phase 2: Review Child Task Readiness

- [ ] Close current verified dirty work before cross-project edits:
  - [ ] Stage only RAG knowledge article / blog skill rule files and regenerated assistant knowledge files.
  - [ ] Commit with a focused message.
  - [ ] Push `origin main` if on `main` and checks are still green.
- [ ] Apply child-first stabilization rule: do not create new implementation work until existing `P1` children are reviewed, started, blocked, or intentionally deferred.
- [ ] Review public assistant frontier RAG artifacts.
- [ ] Review cross-project release readiness tree.
- [ ] For each related repository that may be edited, read local guidance before planning implementation:
  - [ ] `D:\workspace4Cursor\erp`
  - [ ] `D:\workspace4Cursor\legal-rag`
  - [ ] `D:\workspace4Cursor\pet`
  - [ ] `D:\workspace4Codex\xunqiu`
  - [ ] `D:\workspace4Codex\xunqiu-backend-modern`
  - [ ] `D:\workspace4Cursor\game`
- [ ] Review `P1` child readiness in this order:
  - [ ] ERP production registration live verify.
  - [ ] Legal RAG demo access QA closure.
  - [ ] Pet APK public release closure.
  - [ ] Cross-project scheduled reliability observability.
- [ ] Run a discovery sweep across main site data/routes and related project references.
- [ ] Identify which child tasks can proceed without manual actions.
- [ ] Identify which child tasks are blocked by manual actions.
- [ ] Create or update child tasks for discovered gaps with independent deliverables.
- [ ] Update `manual-actions.md`.

## Phase 3: Continuous Autonomous Work Loop

Repeat while the user is away and context/time allows:

1. Check `git status --short`.
2. Check Trellis active tasks.
3. Run a discovery sweep when no obvious in-progress child is available.
4. Pick the highest-value unblocked child task or create/update one for a newly found gap.
5. Load relevant specs before editing.
6. Implement in a small, verifiable slice.
7. Run local validation.
8. Update task artifacts and specs if a reusable rule was learned.
9. Commit and push on `main` when checks pass and the project rules allow it.
10. Record any manual action encountered.

When the selected slice touches a related repository:

1. Enter only the target repository needed for the slice.
2. Read local rules and scripts before edits.
3. Keep changes narrowly tied to the cross-project outcome.
4. Run that repository's smallest relevant validation first, then broader validation when risk justifies it.
5. Keep commits per repository; do not mix unrelated repositories in one commit.

## Progress Log

- 2026-07-06: Started parent task in execution mode and created child
  `07-06-07-06-status-summary-semantics-polish` for an unblocked local status
  UI/data semantics slice. The child separates `/status` entry reachability
  counts from reliability ability coverage counts, updates UI regression
  assertions, and requires no manual gate.
- 2026-07-06: Created child
  `07-06-07-06-ai-daily-doc-current-flow-sync` after discovering
  `docs/ai-daily-pipeline.md` still described the old CLI-first draft flow.
  The child updates documentation to the current Studio-first AI Daily workflow,
  while keeping offline CLI, model calls, production secrets, migrations, and
  automatic publishing as explicit gates.
- 2026-07-06: Completed and archived child
  `07-06-07-06-biau-playlab-public-synthetic`. Added
  `npm.cmd run playlab:synthetic`, wired it into `reliability:check`, generated
  `public/status/biau-playlab-synthetic.json`, and confirmed 6/6 public
  playable pages plus 36/36 discovered Godot Web resources responded. Also
  refreshed missing WebP derivatives so project detail visual checks pass.
- 2026-07-06: Verified the internal assistant member model-channel work was
  already locally complete from `07-06-internal-assistant-finalization`: schema,
  API, admin UI, safe summaries, and mock provider routing exist. Re-ran
  `prisma:validate`, `server:build`, `assistant:service-modes-smoke`, and
  `server:smoke`; all passed without live model calls. Remaining work is
  production env/migration/model validation manual gates.
- 2026-07-06: Fixed `site:monitor -- --check-external` false positives by
  ignoring `rel=preconnect` and `rel=dns-prefetch` connection hints. External
  link checking now stays green on the deployed site instead of treating font
  origin preconnect URLs as clickable links.
- 2026-07-06: Created child `07-06-studio-ai-daily-local-smoke` and added
  `npm.cmd run studio:smoke` as the no-live Content Studio / AI Daily local
  smoke gate. The command wraps Studio sample export, project detail planning,
  status detail planning, and AI Daily sample draft generation while writing
  the AI Daily smoke draft only to the system temp directory.
- 2026-07-06: Polished Xunqiu reliability status semantics so the APK release
  gate no longer reports "API base URL not configured" when the backend API base
  is missing; the gate now correctly points at a separate release artifact
  check and regenerated public status JSON.

## Discovery Sweep Checklist

- [ ] Compare homepage/project cards with `src/data/portfolio.ts`.
- [ ] Compare project detail content with assistant knowledge projections.
- [ ] Compare status targets/checks with project external links and detail pages.
- [ ] Inspect blog curation for project-related gaps or stale references.
- [ ] Inspect public assistant suggestions and retrieval coverage.
- [ ] Review related repo paths as needed for evidence and direct low-risk fixes tied to demo readiness, status accuracy, or build confidence.
- [ ] Record manual blockers in `manual-actions.md`.
- [ ] Create child tasks for gaps that need separate planning/validation.

## Recommended First Autonomous Work Items

Current override: the user wants sustained autonomous improvement. Default
choice policy is now active: use the recommended route below unless a hard
manual gate is encountered.

0. RAG knowledge article / blog skill cleanup commit
   - Why: the current working tree contains already-verified content/rule changes that should be isolated before cross-project work.
   - Allowed work: stage only directly related files, commit, push `origin main`.
   - Manual dependency: none.
   - Risk: low.
1. Legal RAG demo access and status wording closure
   - Why: user reported the demo route was still blocked by login and wants legal Q&A monitored.
   - Allowed related-repo work: login-gate copy, safe demo credential surface, smoke-script clarity, quality-panel display readiness.
   - Manual dependency: public credential/access policy if live checks are needed.
   - Risk: medium.
2. ERP registration display and main-site sync review
   - Why: user repeatedly called out registration availability and demo usability.
   - Allowed related-repo work: login/register UI polish, role-safety copy, local registration smoke, README/demo wording.
   - Manual dependency: live production verification if credentials/deployment needed.
   - Risk: medium.
3. Pet showcase APK gate page/data cleanup
   - Why: user requested homepage connection to Pet showcase and APK public release readiness.
   - Allowed related-repo work: release artifact detection, showcase/download page readiness, build notes, no public debug download.
   - Manual dependency: release APK/signing/checksum approval.
   - Risk: medium.
4. Reliability/status page route and detail polish
   - Why: user already requested status card buttons and detail routes.
   - Allowed related-repo work: smoke-script documentation and public route checks that improve status evidence.
   - Manual dependency: none for local UI/data changes.
   - Risk: low to medium.
5. Public assistant answer style cleanup
   - Why: visible quality issue already observed, but it is `P2` after current release-readiness blockers.
   - Manual dependency: none for local prompt/style/data changes; no model liveness checks.
   - Risk: low.
6. Public assistant knowledge export V2 planning / local deterministic export
   - Why: foundation for Agentic Hybrid RAG.
   - Manual dependency: none if kept local and mockable.
   - Risk: medium.
7. Xunqiu and Game/Playlab public route/build confidence
   - Why: these are public project surfaces represented by BIAU Port cards and status pages.
   - Allowed related-repo work: static site route checks, title/favicon consistency, playable/APK link clarity, docs consistency.
   - Manual dependency: production backend URL, APK release approval, or new playable release approval.
   - Risk: low to medium.

## Validation Commands By Work Type

Planning-only changes:

```powershell
git diff --check
```

Frontend/data changes:

```powershell
npm.cmd run lint
npm.cmd run build
```

Assistant changes:

```powershell
npm.cmd run assistant:index
npm.cmd run cf-assistant:smoke
npm.cmd run server:smoke
npm.cmd run server:build
npm.cmd run lint
npm.cmd run build
```

Blog/content curation:

npm.cmd run verify
```

Related project validation defaults:

```powershell
# ERP
npm.cmd run lint
npm.cmd run build

# Legal RAG
npm.cmd run lint
npm.cmd run build

# Pet
# Use the repository's discovered build/test scripts after reading local docs.

# Xunqiu / xunqiu-backend-modern
# Use static-site build checks for showcase changes and backend health/smoke tests for backend changes.

# Game / Playlab
# Use static-site build checks and playable resource checks discovered from the repo.
```

If a listed command does not exist in the target repository, inspect scripts and choose the nearest local equivalent instead of inventing a new validation path.

## Stop Conditions

Stop and record a manual action instead of continuing when work requires:

- creating or changing cloud resources;
- entering or rotating secrets;
- live model/provider liveness checks;
- production database access;
- APK signing or public release approval;
- real demo credentials;
- paid service selection;
- irreversible public deployment setting changes.
- public release approval for APK/AAB or playable binaries.
- production verification requiring real user accounts or admin access.

## Commit Policy

- Commit only after relevant validation passes.
- Push `main` after successful commit unless the user says not to.
- Keep unrelated dirty files out of commits.
- Do not install automatic Git hooks.
- For related repositories, commit and push only according to that repository's local rules and branch safety. If uncertain, leave a clean commit-ready diff and record the needed user decision.
