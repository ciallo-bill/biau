# Progress

## 2026-07-06 member model channels

Completed a focused internal-assistant slice for per-member model channel assignment.

Implemented:

- Server-only `ASSISTANT_MODEL_CHANNELS_JSON` support for additional OpenAI-compatible model channels.
- Existing `ASSISTANT_MODEL_*` remains the default channel.
- `Member.modelChannelId` persists the selected channel id only; API keys and base URLs stay in environment variables.
- Internal chat passes the member's `modelChannelId` into `generateAnswer()`.
- Chat meta includes a sanitized `modelChannel` summary only.
- Admin APIs:
  - `GET /admin/model-channels`
  - `GET /admin/members`
  - `PATCH /admin/members/:id` for model channel assignment and member status.
- Admin UI can refresh members and assign a model channel per member.
- Assistant member card displays the assigned channel label.
- Deployment docs and `.env.example` describe the multi-channel env shape with placeholders only.

Validation:

- `npm.cmd run prisma:validate`
- `npm.cmd run prisma:generate`
- `npm.cmd run server:build`
- `npm.cmd run server:smoke`
- `npm.cmd run assistant:service-modes-smoke`
- `npm.cmd run assistant:rag-smoke`
- `npm.cmd run lint`
- `npm.cmd run build`
- `npm.cmd run check:ui`
- `git diff --check`

Sensitive scan:

- No real key, database URL, Qdrant endpoint, model relay URL, or token was found.
- The only hit was the documented placeholder `ASSISTANT_MODEL_API_KEY=<OpenAI 兼容中转 Key>`.

Manual gate:

- User must configure real `ASSISTANT_MODEL_CHANNELS_JSON` values in Render or another private environment before production use.

## 2026-07-06 internal session history

Completed the next focused internal-assistant slice for member-scoped persistent session history.

Implemented:

- Member-protected session APIs:
  - `GET /chat/internal/sessions`
  - `POST /chat/internal/sessions`
  - `GET /chat/internal/sessions/:id/messages`
  - `PATCH /chat/internal/sessions/:id`
- Internal chat now rejects cross-member or missing `sessionId` with `session-not-found` instead of creating or attaching to the wrong session.
- Internal chat rejects disabled members before persistence.
- Session previews include safe title, preview, updated time, created time, and archive state.
- `/assistant` now uses real API-backed history instead of demo sessions:
  - member profile sync
  - session list sync
  - message loading
  - new session creation
  - current session archive
  - clearer token/database degraded states
- `src/data/assistant.ts` owns session/message payload normalizers.
- Smoke tests now assert protected session route behavior and service-mode route isolation.
- Backend quality spec now records the internal session-history contract.

Validation:

- `npm.cmd run prisma:validate`
- `npm.cmd run prisma:generate`
- `npm.cmd run server:build`
- `npm.cmd run server:smoke`
- `npm.cmd run assistant:service-modes-smoke`
- `npm.cmd run assistant:rag-smoke`
- `npm.cmd run lint`
- `npm.cmd run build`
- `npm.cmd run check:ui`
- `git diff --check`

Sensitive scan:

- No real key, database URL, Qdrant endpoint, model relay URL, admin token, member token, or invite code was found.
- Hits were limited to placeholders, smoke-test values, local `127.0.0.1` mock endpoints, and code variable names.

Manual gate:

- Production validation still requires the user-managed Render database, migrations, member token, and real internal assistant API deployment. Local checks intentionally did not call live model/provider channels.

## 2026-07-06 admin invite and member controls

Completed the next focused admin-management slice for internal assistant operations.

Implemented:

- `/admin/summary` now includes invite state counts: open, revoked, expired, exhausted.
- Added admin invite APIs:
  - `GET /admin/invites`
  - `PATCH /admin/invites/:id` with `{ revoked: boolean }`
- Invite list responses expose safe metadata only and never include plaintext invite codes or `codeHash`.
- Existing invite redemption already rejects revoked invites through `revokedAt`.
- `/assistant/admin` now supports:
  - refreshing invite metadata
  - revoking/restoring invites
  - enabling/disabling members
  - displaying safe invite/member statuses
- `src/data/assistant.ts` owns invite payload normalizers.
- Smoke tests now cover admin invite auth/no-database behavior and service-mode isolation.
- Backend quality spec now records the admin-control contract.

Validation:

- `npm.cmd run prisma:validate`
- `npm.cmd run server:build`
- `npm.cmd run server:smoke`
- `npm.cmd run assistant:service-modes-smoke`
- `npm.cmd run lint`
- `npm.cmd run build`
- `npm.cmd run check:ui`

Manual gate:

- Production admin control validation still requires the deployed internal API, migrated database, and user-managed `ADMIN_TOKEN`. Local validation did not create, revoke, or inspect production invites.

## 2026-07-06 internal knowledge admin groundwork

Completed the next focused slice for curated internal knowledge management and local-safe sync groundwork.

Implemented:

- Added additive Prisma models and migration:
  - `InternalKnowledgeDocument`
  - `InternalKnowledgeSyncRun`
  - `InternalKnowledgeStatus`
  - `InternalKnowledgeSyncStatus`
- Added admin knowledge APIs:
  - `GET /admin/knowledge-documents`
  - `POST /admin/knowledge-documents`
  - `PATCH /admin/knowledge-documents/:id`
  - `POST /admin/knowledge/sync`
- `/admin/summary` now reports internal knowledge document count and last internal sync run.
- Knowledge documents keep title, slug, summary, body, tags, status, source type, safety notes, content hash, and `lastSyncedAt`.
- Sync eligibility is restricted to `REVIEWED` and `ACTIVE` documents.
- Missing RAG sync configuration records a low-sensitive `SKIPPED` sync run instead of failing the admin workspace.
- RAG `/v1/sync` now accepts `scope: "internal"` plus document payloads and returns local-readonly diagnostics in local mode.
- `/assistant/admin` now has a Knowledge area for creating/editing documents, refreshing documents, and triggering sync.
- Frontend assistant data normalizers now cover internal knowledge documents and sync runs.
- Smoke tests cover admin knowledge route auth/no-database behavior, service-mode isolation, and local-readonly internal sync payloads.
- `docs/deployment.md` and `.env.example` now state that Internal Assistant API needs the same `RAG_SYNC_TOKEN` to submit reviewed/active internal documents to the Orchestrator.
- Backend quality spec now records the internal knowledge admin/sync contract.

Validation:

- `npm.cmd run prisma:validate`
- `npm.cmd run prisma:generate`
- `npm.cmd run server:build`
- `npm.cmd run server:smoke`
- `npm.cmd run assistant:service-modes-smoke`
- `npm.cmd run assistant:rag-smoke`
- `npm.cmd run assistant:rag-sync-local`
- `npm.cmd run lint`
- `npm.cmd run build`
- `npm.cmd run check:ui`

Manual gate:

- Production deployment must run the new migration before using the Knowledge area.
- Real internal Qdrant/embedding sync still requires user approval and configured `ASSISTANT_RAG_API_BASE_URL` plus `RAG_SYNC_TOKEN`.
- First real internal corpus still requires user-confirmed source and脱敏标准.

## 2026-07-06 Qdrant internal corpus sync

Completed the next RAG Orchestrator slice for the final internal knowledge path.

Implemented:

- `syncRagStore({ scope: "internal" })` now routes to Qdrant when `RAG_STORE_PROVIDER=qdrant` is selected and Qdrant config is available.
- Added Qdrant internal sync support:
  - normalize internal sync documents
  - preserve paragraph boundaries for chunking
  - chunk internal documents with stable `internal:<documentId>:chunk:<n>` ids
  - generate embeddings through the existing embedding boundary
  - upsert points only into `QDRANT_INTERNAL_COLLECTION`
  - mark payloads as `visibility: "internal"` and `source: "internal-knowledge-documents"`
  - delete stale internal points for that source after accepted sync
- Public Qdrant sync remains scoped to `QDRANT_PUBLIC_COLLECTION` and public payloads.
- `RagSyncResponse` now includes optional `scope` so sync diagnostics can clearly distinguish public/internal without exposing endpoints or secrets.
- Internal API sync result classification now treats `mode: "qdrant"` plus `accepted: false` as `FAILED`, while `local-readonly` remains `SKIPPED`.
- `assistant:rag-smoke` now includes a local in-memory Qdrant mock proving:
  - internal sync can be accepted by Qdrant without live cloud calls
  - internal retrieve returns internal citations for `scope: "internal"`
  - public retrieve does not return internal citations
- `docs/deployment.md` now clarifies that configured Qdrant writes `scope=internal` chunks into `QDRANT_INTERNAL_COLLECTION`; local/unconfigured sync remains readonly/diagnostic.
- Backend quality spec now records the internal Qdrant sync contract and the required mock coverage.

Validation:

- `npm.cmd run server:build`
- `npm.cmd run server:smoke`
- `npm.cmd run assistant:rag-smoke`
- `npm.cmd run assistant:service-modes-smoke`

Manual gate:

- Real production internal corpus sync still requires user-approved reviewed/active documents plus deployed Render env for `ASSISTANT_RAG_API_BASE_URL`, `RAG_SYNC_TOKEN`, `QDRANT_*`, and `EMBEDDING_*`.
- No real Qdrant, embedding provider, model provider, or relay endpoint was called during local validation.

## 2026-07-06 admin workspace tabs and usage

Completed a focused admin workspace slice for AC4/R6.

Implemented:

- Added `GET /admin/usage` with admin-token protection and database guard.
- Usage responses are bounded to the latest 50 rows and expose only low-sensitive fields:
  - usage id
  - scope
  - model
  - tokens in/out
  - created time
  - safe member summary and safe model-channel summary
- Added `normalizeAssistantUsageSummaries()` and related frontend types.
- Converted `/assistant/admin` from one long card grid into tabs:
  - Overview
  - Invites
  - Members
  - Knowledge
  - Usage
  - Safety
- Removed outdated "first version owner-only" copy from the admin hero.
- Added a Usage tab that loads the new API and renders recent usage without message text, prompt text, citations, token hashes, invite hashes, provider URLs, or request bodies.
- Smoke tests now cover `/admin/usage` auth/no-database behavior and service-mode route isolation.
- Deployment docs now list the expanded admin route map and current admin workspace capabilities.
- Backend quality spec now records the safe usage-reporting contract.

Validation:

- `npm.cmd run server:build`
- `npm.cmd run server:smoke`
- `npm.cmd run assistant:service-modes-smoke`
- `npm.cmd run lint`
- `npm.cmd run build`
- `npm.cmd run check:ui`

Manual gate:

- Production usage list validation still requires the deployed internal API, migrated database, and user-managed `ADMIN_TOKEN`.

## 2026-07-06 internal answer diagnostics panel

Completed a focused internal workspace slice for answer visibility.

Implemented:

- Added frontend normalizers for assistant answer meta and retrieval summaries.
- `/assistant` now reads `payload.meta` through `normalizeAssistantAnswerMeta()` instead of casting response fields in the page.
- The internal workspace right panel now shows:
  - answer mode and fallback reason
  - model and assigned model-channel label
  - citation count
  - low-sensitive retrieval diagnostics such as source, store, sufficiency, and candidate count
  - recent citation titles from the latest assistant answer
- Reset paths now clear stale answer diagnostics when the member logs out, redeems a new invite, creates a new session, archives a session, or falls back locally.
- Added CSS for compact diagnostic chips without exposing provider endpoints, keys, prompts, or raw payloads.
- Frontend state-management spec now records the answer-meta panel contract.

Validation:

- `npm.cmd run lint`
- `npm.cmd run build`
- `npm.cmd run check:ui`

Manual gate:

- Production verification of real answer quality and live provider behavior still requires user-approved real tasks. This slice only displays sanitized metadata returned by the internal API and does not call live model channels.

## 2026-07-06 public facts refresh for internal assistant

Completed a small public-content consistency slice after the internal assistant workspace moved beyond the original MVP copy.

Implemented:

- Removed unused legacy `demoInternalSessions` and `demoInternalMessages` exports from `src/data/assistant.ts`.
- Updated the BIAU Port project case page copy to describe the current internal assistant shape:
  - member workspace with invite redemption and identity checks
  - real session history and archive flow
  - member-level model channels
  - admin workspace for invites, members, knowledge, sync status, and low-sensitive usage
  - internal knowledge management and Qdrant internal collection sync path
- Kept production gates explicit: Render env vars, migrations, approved internal corpus, and user-approved real model tasks are still required for production validation.
- Regenerated `server/data/public-knowledge.json` and `server/data/public-knowledge-v2.json` so the public assistant no longer repeats stale "internal assistant MVP" facts for the main site project.

Validation:

- `npm.cmd run assistant:index`

Manual gate:

- None for this content refresh beyond the existing production configuration gates.

## 2026-07-06 persisted answer metadata

Completed a cross-layer fix for internal assistant historical diagnostics.

Implemented:

- Added additive Prisma field `ChatMessage.meta Json?` plus migration `20260706020000_chat_message_meta`.
- Internal chat now builds one sanitized answer-meta object and uses it for both:
  - immediate `POST /chat/internal` response
  - persisted assistant `ChatMessage.meta`
- Persisted meta includes mode, model, provider, fallback reason, safe model-channel summary, citation count, retrieval summary, intent, and grounding.
- Persisted meta intentionally excludes provider diagnostic bodies, API keys, model base URLs, RAG URLs, Qdrant endpoints, request headers, member/admin tokens, raw prompts, and private source text.
- Historical message serialization returns sanitized `meta` or `null`.
- `normalizeAssistantMessage()` decodes optional `message.meta` through `normalizeAssistantAnswerMeta()`.
- `/assistant` restores the right-side answer diagnostics from the latest assistant message when loading a historical session, and clears stale diagnostics while switching sessions.
- Backend and frontend specs now record the historical answer-meta contract.

Validation:

- `npm.cmd run prisma:validate`
- `npm.cmd run prisma:generate`
- `npm.cmd run server:build`
- `npm.cmd run server:smoke`
- `npm.cmd run assistant:service-modes-smoke`
- `npm.cmd run assistant:rag-smoke`
- `npm.cmd run lint`
- `npm.cmd run build`
- `npm.cmd run check:ui`

Manual gate:

- Production deployment must run the new migration before historical answer diagnostics can persist for new messages. Existing messages safely show no historical diagnostics until new answers are generated.

## 2026-07-06 verification and AC audit

Ran a broad current-HEAD verification pass after the internal assistant finalization slices.

Validation:

- `npm.cmd run verify`
  - `assistant:index`
  - `prisma:validate`
  - `lint`
  - `server:build`
  - `server:smoke`
  - `cf-assistant:smoke`
  - `build`
  - `blog:check`
  - `preview`
  - `check:ui`
- `npm.cmd run assistant:service-modes-smoke`
- `npm.cmd run assistant:rag-smoke`
- `npm.cmd run assistant:rag-sync-local`
- `npm.cmd run site:status`

Current AC audit:

- AC1 `/assistant` workspace UI:
  - Locally supported by current `/assistant` route implementation, removal of legacy demo session exports, `check:ui`, and route rendering checks.
  - Verified states include unauthenticated/local fallback, no default public widget on assistant route, suggestion send, assistant answer bubble, citations, route layout, and no horizontal overflow.
  - Real deployed API states for a migrated member with existing history still require production internal API + database validation.
- AC2 member-scoped session APIs:
  - Implemented routes: `GET/POST /chat/internal/sessions`, `GET/PATCH /chat/internal/sessions/:id`, and `POST /chat/internal`.
  - Code scopes session lookup by `{ id, memberId }`; missing/cross-member session ids return `session-not-found`.
  - Smoke verifies missing auth and no-database low-sensitive behavior; live member-isolation e2e needs a migrated production or test Postgres.
- AC3 scoped internal RAG:
  - Internal chat calls `retrieveAssistantContext(question, "internal")`.
  - RAG service-mode smoke and RAG smoke verify scoped route boundaries and public/internal Qdrant isolation with local/mock stores.
  - Real internal key + Qdrant collection behavior requires Render/Qdrant env validation.
- AC4 admin management:
  - Admin UI now has Overview, Invites, Members, Knowledge, Usage, and Safety tabs.
  - APIs cover members, invites, model channels, internal knowledge docs/sync, and usage.
  - Smoke verifies auth/no-database behavior and service-mode isolation; production validation requires deployed `ADMIN_TOKEN` and migrated database.
- AC5 internal knowledge and sync:
  - Prisma models, admin APIs, sync run recording, local-readonly fallback, Qdrant internal sync path, and mock RAG coverage are implemented.
  - `assistant:rag-sync-local` validates local sync plan; true embedding/Qdrant sync is user-approved manual gate.
- AC6 member model channels:
  - Implemented `ASSISTANT_MODEL_CHANNELS_JSON`, `Member.modelChannelId`, admin assignment UI, safe summaries, and internal chat routing.
  - Smoke uses local mock provider only; no live provider测活 was run.
- AC7 checks:
  - Required local gates passed, including `verify`, `assistant:service-modes-smoke`, `assistant:rag-smoke`, `assistant:rag-sync-local`, and `site:status`.
- AC8 docs/status/manual gates:
  - Deployment docs and specs describe service boundaries, internal RAG/Qdrant config, model channels, sync token, and database SSL compatibility.
  - Manual gates list Render env vars, migrations, internal corpus approval, Qdrant sync approval, real model validation approval, and internal entry visibility.
  - `public/status/site-status.json` refreshed with 5/5 online public targets.

Conclusion:

- Local code, docs, generated public knowledge, service-mode isolation, mock RAG sync, and UI checks are in good shape for the task's implementation scope.
- The remaining proof points are platform/manual gates, not local code blockers: production migrations, Render envs, real internal corpus approval, real Qdrant/embedding sync, and user-approved real model tasks.
