# Progress

## 2026-07-06 member model channels

Completed a focused internal-assistant slice for per-member model channel assignment.

Implemented:

- Server-only `ASSISTANT_MODEL_CHANNELS_JSON` support for additional OpenAI-compatible model channels.
- Existing `ASSISTANT_MODEL_*` remains the default channel.
- `Member.modelChannelId` persists the selected channel id only; API keys and base URLs stay in environment variables.
- Internal chat passes the member's `modelChannelId` into `generateAnswer()`.
- Chat meta includes a sanitized `modelChannel` summary only.
- Admin APIs:
  - `GET /admin/model-channels`
  - `GET /admin/members`
  - `PATCH /admin/members/:id` for model channel assignment and member status.
- Admin UI can refresh members and assign a model channel per member.
- Assistant member card displays the assigned channel label.
- Deployment docs and `.env.example` describe the multi-channel env shape with placeholders only.

Validation:

- `npm.cmd run prisma:validate`
- `npm.cmd run prisma:generate`
- `npm.cmd run server:build`
- `npm.cmd run server:smoke`
- `npm.cmd run assistant:service-modes-smoke`
- `npm.cmd run assistant:rag-smoke`
- `npm.cmd run lint`
- `npm.cmd run build`
- `npm.cmd run check:ui`
- `git diff --check`

Sensitive scan:

- No real key, database URL, Qdrant endpoint, model relay URL, or token was found.
- The only hit was the documented placeholder `ASSISTANT_MODEL_API_KEY=<OpenAI 兼容中转 Key>`.

Manual gate:

- User must configure real `ASSISTANT_MODEL_CHANNELS_JSON` values in Render or another private environment before production use.

## 2026-07-06 internal session history

Completed the next focused internal-assistant slice for member-scoped persistent session history.

Implemented:

- Member-protected session APIs:
  - `GET /chat/internal/sessions`
  - `POST /chat/internal/sessions`
  - `GET /chat/internal/sessions/:id/messages`
  - `PATCH /chat/internal/sessions/:id`
- Internal chat now rejects cross-member or missing `sessionId` with `session-not-found` instead of creating or attaching to the wrong session.
- Internal chat rejects disabled members before persistence.
- Session previews include safe title, preview, updated time, created time, and archive state.
- `/assistant` now uses real API-backed history instead of demo sessions:
  - member profile sync
  - session list sync
  - message loading
  - new session creation
  - current session archive
  - clearer token/database degraded states
- `src/data/assistant.ts` owns session/message payload normalizers.
- Smoke tests now assert protected session route behavior and service-mode route isolation.
- Backend quality spec now records the internal session-history contract.

Validation:

- `npm.cmd run prisma:validate`
- `npm.cmd run prisma:generate`
- `npm.cmd run server:build`
- `npm.cmd run server:smoke`
- `npm.cmd run assistant:service-modes-smoke`
- `npm.cmd run assistant:rag-smoke`
- `npm.cmd run lint`
- `npm.cmd run build`
- `npm.cmd run check:ui`
- `git diff --check`

Sensitive scan:

- No real key, database URL, Qdrant endpoint, model relay URL, admin token, member token, or invite code was found.
- Hits were limited to placeholders, smoke-test values, local `127.0.0.1` mock endpoints, and code variable names.

Manual gate:

- Production validation still requires the user-managed Render database, migrations, member token, and real internal assistant API deployment. Local checks intentionally did not call live model/provider channels.

## 2026-07-06 admin invite and member controls

Completed the next focused admin-management slice for internal assistant operations.

Implemented:

- `/admin/summary` now includes invite state counts: open, revoked, expired, exhausted.
- Added admin invite APIs:
  - `GET /admin/invites`
  - `PATCH /admin/invites/:id` with `{ revoked: boolean }`
- Invite list responses expose safe metadata only and never include plaintext invite codes or `codeHash`.
- Existing invite redemption already rejects revoked invites through `revokedAt`.
- `/assistant/admin` now supports:
  - refreshing invite metadata
  - revoking/restoring invites
  - enabling/disabling members
  - displaying safe invite/member statuses
- `src/data/assistant.ts` owns invite payload normalizers.
- Smoke tests now cover admin invite auth/no-database behavior and service-mode isolation.
- Backend quality spec now records the admin-control contract.

Validation:

- `npm.cmd run prisma:validate`
- `npm.cmd run server:build`
- `npm.cmd run server:smoke`
- `npm.cmd run assistant:service-modes-smoke`
- `npm.cmd run lint`
- `npm.cmd run build`
- `npm.cmd run check:ui`

Manual gate:

- Production admin control validation still requires the deployed internal API, migrated database, and user-managed `ADMIN_TOKEN`. Local validation did not create, revoke, or inspect production invites.

## 2026-07-06 internal knowledge admin groundwork

Completed the next focused slice for curated internal knowledge management and local-safe sync groundwork.

Implemented:

- Added additive Prisma models and migration:
  - `InternalKnowledgeDocument`
  - `InternalKnowledgeSyncRun`
  - `InternalKnowledgeStatus`
  - `InternalKnowledgeSyncStatus`
- Added admin knowledge APIs:
  - `GET /admin/knowledge-documents`
  - `POST /admin/knowledge-documents`
  - `PATCH /admin/knowledge-documents/:id`
  - `POST /admin/knowledge/sync`
- `/admin/summary` now reports internal knowledge document count and last internal sync run.
- Knowledge documents keep title, slug, summary, body, tags, status, source type, safety notes, content hash, and `lastSyncedAt`.
- Sync eligibility is restricted to `REVIEWED` and `ACTIVE` documents.
- Missing RAG sync configuration records a low-sensitive `SKIPPED` sync run instead of failing the admin workspace.
- RAG `/v1/sync` now accepts `scope: "internal"` plus document payloads and returns local-readonly diagnostics in local mode.
- `/assistant/admin` now has a Knowledge area for creating/editing documents, refreshing documents, and triggering sync.
- Frontend assistant data normalizers now cover internal knowledge documents and sync runs.
- Smoke tests cover admin knowledge route auth/no-database behavior, service-mode isolation, and local-readonly internal sync payloads.
- `docs/deployment.md` and `.env.example` now state that Internal Assistant API needs the same `RAG_SYNC_TOKEN` to submit reviewed/active internal documents to the Orchestrator.
- Backend quality spec now records the internal knowledge admin/sync contract.

Validation:

- `npm.cmd run prisma:validate`
- `npm.cmd run prisma:generate`
- `npm.cmd run server:build`
- `npm.cmd run server:smoke`
- `npm.cmd run assistant:service-modes-smoke`
- `npm.cmd run assistant:rag-smoke`
- `npm.cmd run assistant:rag-sync-local`
- `npm.cmd run lint`
- `npm.cmd run build`
- `npm.cmd run check:ui`

Manual gate:

- Production deployment must run the new migration before using the Knowledge area.
- Real internal Qdrant/embedding sync still requires user approval and configured `ASSISTANT_RAG_API_BASE_URL` plus `RAG_SYNC_TOKEN`.
- First real internal corpus still requires user-confirmed source and脱敏标准.

## 2026-07-06 Qdrant internal corpus sync

Completed the next RAG Orchestrator slice for the final internal knowledge path.

Implemented:

- `syncRagStore({ scope: "internal" })` now routes to Qdrant when `RAG_STORE_PROVIDER=qdrant` is selected and Qdrant config is available.
- Added Qdrant internal sync support:
  - normalize internal sync documents
  - preserve paragraph boundaries for chunking
  - chunk internal documents with stable `internal:<documentId>:chunk:<n>` ids
  - generate embeddings through the existing embedding boundary
  - upsert points only into `QDRANT_INTERNAL_COLLECTION`
  - mark payloads as `visibility: "internal"` and `source: "internal-knowledge-documents"`
  - delete stale internal points for that source after accepted sync
- Public Qdrant sync remains scoped to `QDRANT_PUBLIC_COLLECTION` and public payloads.
- `RagSyncResponse` now includes optional `scope` so sync diagnostics can clearly distinguish public/internal without exposing endpoints or secrets.
- Internal API sync result classification now treats `mode: "qdrant"` plus `accepted: false` as `FAILED`, while `local-readonly` remains `SKIPPED`.
- `assistant:rag-smoke` now includes a local in-memory Qdrant mock proving:
  - internal sync can be accepted by Qdrant without live cloud calls
  - internal retrieve returns internal citations for `scope: "internal"`
  - public retrieve does not return internal citations
- `docs/deployment.md` now clarifies that configured Qdrant writes `scope=internal` chunks into `QDRANT_INTERNAL_COLLECTION`; local/unconfigured sync remains readonly/diagnostic.
- Backend quality spec now records the internal Qdrant sync contract and the required mock coverage.

Validation:

- `npm.cmd run server:build`
- `npm.cmd run server:smoke`
- `npm.cmd run assistant:rag-smoke`
- `npm.cmd run assistant:service-modes-smoke`

Manual gate:

- Real production internal corpus sync still requires user-approved reviewed/active documents plus deployed Render env for `ASSISTANT_RAG_API_BASE_URL`, `RAG_SYNC_TOKEN`, `QDRANT_*`, and `EMBEDDING_*`.
- No real Qdrant, embedding provider, model provider, or relay endpoint was called during local validation.
