# Backend Development Guidelines

These guidelines describe the assistant API and database layer that sit beside the Vite frontend. Read them before changing `server/`, `prisma/`, backend scripts, environment contracts, or API-facing data flow.

## Pre-Development Checklist

Before backend edits:

- Read [Directory Structure](./directory-structure.md) for file ownership and server module boundaries.
- Read [Database Guidelines](./database-guidelines.md) before touching Prisma, persistence, invites, members, sessions, messages, or usage logs.
- Read [Error Handling](./error-handling.md) before adding or changing routes.
- Read [Logging Guidelines](./logging-guidelines.md) before adding logs.
- Read [Observability Guidelines](./observability-guidelines.md) before adding metrics, monitoring endpoints, RUM, tracing, or alert hooks.
- Read [Internal Assistant Agentic Workspace](./agentic-workspace.md) before changing `/chat/internal`, Agent tools, internal answer metadata, or `/assistant` diagnostics.
- Read [Quality Guidelines](./quality-guidelines.md) before declaring backend work complete.
- Read [Blog Draft Workflow](./blog-draft-workflow.md) before changing `scripts/generate-blog-draft.mjs`, blog draft model channels, or blog draft env variables.
- Read [AI Daily Workflow](./ai-daily-workflow.md) before changing `scripts/generate-ai-daily-draft.mjs`, AI Daily source packs, or AI Daily publication gates.

## Local Rules Imported

These specs incorporate rules from `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursor/rules/data-safety.mdc`, and `.cursor/rules/verify.mdc`, plus the current `server/`, `prisma/`, and `scripts/verify.mjs` implementation.

## Core Project Rules

- Never commit real IPs, accounts, secrets, database URLs, cloud API URLs, signing paths, certificates, or private business metrics.
- Use `.env.example` for environment shape; do not read or quote private `.env*` or key files.
- Keep public assistant behavior usable without a configured database or model provider unless a task explicitly changes that contract.
- Run the relevant Prisma/server/lint/build checks after backend changes.
