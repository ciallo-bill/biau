# Backend Quality Guidelines

## Required Verification

Backend and full-project changes should pass the relevant commands from `package.json`:

```powershell
npm.cmd run prisma:validate
npm.cmd run server:build
npm.cmd run server:smoke
npm.cmd run lint
npm.cmd run build
```

For broad confidence before handoff, run:

```powershell
npm.cmd run verify
```

`verify` runs assistant knowledge generation, assistant V2 knowledge graph checks, offline assistant RAG eval, local RAG sync planning, assistant metadata checks, Prisma validation, lint, server build, smoke tests, assistant service-mode isolation, local/mock RAG orchestrator smoke, Cloudflare function smoke, frontend build, blog check, Studio/AI Daily local smoke, project detail evidence checks, status contract checks, preview startup, and UI checks.

The assistant/RAG checks included in `verify` are deterministic local gates:
`assistant:eval` reports `modelCalls=0`, `assistant:rag-sync-local` reads the
generated local knowledge file, `assistant:service-modes-smoke` starts local
services with fake tokens, and `assistant:rag-smoke` uses the local app plus a
mock Qdrant server. They are not live model/provider diagnostics.

## Smoke Test Contract

`server/scripts/smoke.ts` is the minimum backend behavior gate. It starts the Express app on an available localhost port and verifies:

- `/health` returns OK.
- `/chat/public` accepts `RAG 项目`, returns an answer plus citations array, and cites `project:legal-rag` so the test catches public-knowledge path or indexing regressions.
- `/chat/internal` rejects unauthenticated requests with `401`.

Do not break these behaviors when changing app middleware, auth, model fallback, or database guards.

## Environment Safety

Use `server/src/env.ts` as the single place for reading environment variables. Keep defaults non-sensitive and local-development friendly. The current public model fallback allows the assistant API to run without `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

Do not read `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.*.local`, private key files, or SSH files into task context. Use `.env.example` when documenting expected shape.

## Scenario: Deployment CORS Origin Normalization

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: changing backend environment parsing, CORS middleware, Render service variables, or browser-facing API base URLs.

### 2. Signatures

- Env: `CORS_ORIGIN`
- Runtime field: `env.corsOrigin`
- Middleware: Express `cors({ origin: env.corsOrigin })`

### 3. Contracts

- `CORS_ORIGIN` is an origin only: protocol + host + optional port.
- It must not include a path, query string, or fragment.
- The backend trims whitespace and removes trailing slashes before passing it to CORS.
- `*` remains supported for local/simple deployments.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- `CORS_ORIGIN=https://biau.playlab.eu.cc/` -> normalized to `https://biau.playlab.eu.cc`.
- Browser `Origin: https://biau.playlab.eu.cc` -> `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://biau.playlab.eu.cc`.
- `CORS_ORIGIN=*` -> wildcard behavior remains unchanged.
- Path-shaped values such as `https://biau.playlab.eu.cc/studio` are invalid deployment config and should be corrected in platform variables.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: Render sets `CORS_ORIGIN=https://biau.playlab.eu.cc` and Cloudflare Pages sets `VITE_STUDIO_API_BASE_URL` to the Studio API service origin.
- Base: a trailing slash is accidentally included; backend normalization still matches the browser origin.
- Bad: frontend code attempts to solve CORS by exposing server tokens, database URLs, or private API keys.

### 6. Tests Required

- Run `npm.cmd run server:build` after changing env parsing.
- Run `npm.cmd run server:smoke` and `npm.cmd run assistant:service-modes-smoke` after changing CORS or service modes.
- Verify browser failures with sanitized status/CORS diagnostics before asking the user to rotate secrets.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```text
CORS_ORIGIN=https://biau.playlab.eu.cc/studio/
```

This is a route URL, not the browser origin, so it can fail CORS matching.

#### Correct

```text
CORS_ORIGIN=https://biau.playlab.eu.cc
```

The browser sends only the origin in the `Origin` header, so the backend should compare against the same value.

## Scenario: Public Assistant Model Provider

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: `/chat/public` adds or changes an OpenAI-compatible model provider, model fallback behavior, or model-related environment keys.

### 2. Signatures

- `POST /chat/public` accepts `{ message: string }`.
- The response remains `ChatResponse`: `{ answer, citations, meta }`.
- `meta.mode` is `'model' | 'fallback'`.
- `meta.reason` for fallback can be `'not_configured'`, `'provider_error'`, `'empty_response'`, or `'no_public_context'`.
- `meta.diagnostic`, when present, is low-sensitivity provider troubleshooting
  only: `{ kind, httpStatus?, attemptedEndpoints, timeoutMs }`.

### 3. Contracts

- Model environment keys are server-only: `ASSISTANT_MODEL_BASE_URL`, `ASSISTANT_MODEL_API_KEY`, `ASSISTANT_MODEL_NAME`, and `ASSISTANT_MODEL_PROVIDER`.
- Legacy `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, and `OPENAI_MODEL` may remain supported, but new docs should prefer `ASSISTANT_MODEL_*`.
- The frontend only uses `VITE_CHAT_API_BASE_URL`; never expose model base URLs or API keys through Vite variables.
- Public-scope model calls must be grounded in public citations from `server/data/public-knowledge.json`.
- If public search returns zero citations, return fallback with `reason: 'no_public_context'` and do not call the provider.
- Cloudflare Pages can serve same-domain public assistant endpoints through `functions/api/health.ts` and `functions/api/chat/public.ts`. Keep these endpoints compatible with the same `ChatResponse` shape as the Express `/health` and `/chat/public` routes.
- OpenAI-compatible provider calls use a 20 second timeout. On provider fallback,
  `meta.diagnostic.kind` may be `timeout`, `network_error`, `http_status`, or
  `empty_response`. Do not include endpoint URLs, API keys, request bodies, raw
  provider responses, stack traces, or prompt text in `meta.diagnostic`.
- A live GLM/API key check is only meaningful after the deployed host proves that
  Pages Functions are active. `GET /api/health` must return JSON; if it returns
  the static site HTML, or `POST /api/chat/public` returns `404` / `405`, treat
  the blocker as missing or stale Cloudflare Pages Functions deployment, not as a
  model-provider or API-key failure.
- Live `/api/chat/public` checks can invoke a real model provider when production
  model env is configured. Do not run them as a default liveness probe; require
  explicit user approval or the `main-site:synthetic -- --assistant-chat` /
  `MAIN_SITE_SYNTHETIC_ASSISTANT_CHAT=1` opt-in gate.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Missing model key or base URL -> `meta.mode: 'fallback'`, `reason: 'not_configured'`.
- Live `/api/health` returns HTML instead of JSON -> deployment blocker:
  Cloudflare Pages is serving only the static app or an older build.
- Live `/api/chat/public` returns `404` / `405` while local
  `cf-assistant:smoke` passes -> deployment blocker: Functions are missing,
  disabled, or not included in the current Pages deployment.
- Provider network failure, non-OK response, or timeout -> `meta.mode: 'fallback'`, `reason: 'provider_error'`.
- Provider timeout -> `meta.diagnostic: { kind: 'timeout', attemptedEndpoints, timeoutMs: 20000 }`.
- Provider network failure -> `meta.diagnostic.kind: 'network_error'`.
- Provider non-OK response -> `meta.diagnostic.kind: 'http_status'` and only the numeric `httpStatus`.
- Provider returns no message content -> `meta.mode: 'fallback'`, `reason: 'empty_response'`.
- Provider returns an OK response with no message content -> `meta.diagnostic.kind: 'empty_response'`.
- Public question has no matching public citations -> `meta.mode: 'fallback'`, `reason: 'no_public_context'`.
- Public chat should not return raw provider errors, tokens, base URLs, stack traces, or prompt text.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: a GLM-compatible relay is configured in deployment env, `/chat/public` returns a concise model answer plus public citations, and the frontend labels it as model-enhanced without showing provider details.
- Base: no provider env is configured; `/chat/public` still answers from sanitized public knowledge.
- Bad: the browser bundle contains `ASSISTANT_MODEL_API_KEY`, a real relay URL, or a fallback path that calls the provider with no public context.

### 6. Tests Required

- `server:smoke` must cover configured OpenAI-compatible success, unconfigured fallback, provider failure fallback, `/health`, and protected internal auth behavior.
- `cf-assistant:smoke` must cover the Cloudflare Pages Function fallback, configured OpenAI-compatible success, and provider failure fallback.
- Provider failure smoke checks must assert `meta.diagnostic` exists and contains
  only low-sensitivity fields.
- `check:ui` should assert the public assistant opens in a concise default state before citations appear.
- Before asking a user to rotate or re-enter `ASSISTANT_MODEL_*`, verify the
  live deployment layer first: `/api/health` must return JSON from the Function,
  then `/api/chat/public` can be checked for `meta.mode` only through an
  approved real task prompt or the explicit assistant-chat synthetic opt-in.
- Run `assistant:index`, `server:build`, `server:smoke`, `lint`, `build`, `prisma:validate`, `git diff --check`, and a sensitive-value scan after model-provider work.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```ts
fetch(`${import.meta.env.VITE_ASSISTANT_MODEL_BASE_URL}/chat/completions`, {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${import.meta.env.VITE_ASSISTANT_MODEL_API_KEY}` },
})
```

This puts the model channel in the browser and risks exposing private credentials.

#### Correct

```ts
const response = await fetch(`${modelConfig.baseUrl}/chat/completions`, {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${modelConfig.apiKey}` },
})
```

The server reads private env, applies public-citation grounding, and returns only sanitized `ChatResponse` fields to the frontend.

## API Review Checklist

- Inputs are trimmed, required fields are checked, and strings stored as names/titles are length-capped.
- Protected routes verify bearer/admin tokens before database writes or reads.
- Database-required routes use `requireDatabase()` and get a 503 when no database is configured.
- Public routes still work without a database or model provider.
- Error responses use stable error codes and do not leak internals.
- Tokens and invite codes are hashed before persistence.

## Scenario: Internal Assistant Member Model Channels

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: adding or changing per-member model routing, model-channel admin UI, assistant model env parsing, internal chat generation, member APIs, or the `Member.modelChannelId` database field.
- Goal: let owner/admin assign different OpenAI-compatible model channels to internal members without storing provider secrets in the database or browser.

### 2. Signatures

- Env:
  - Default channel: `ASSISTANT_MODEL_BASE_URL`, `ASSISTANT_MODEL_API_KEY`, `ASSISTANT_MODEL_NAME`, `ASSISTANT_MODEL_PROVIDER`.
  - Extra channels: `ASSISTANT_MODEL_CHANNELS_JSON`.
- DB:
  - `Member.modelChannelId String?` stores only a safe channel id.
- Internal chat:
  - `POST /chat/internal` reads the authenticated member and passes `member.modelChannelId` to `generateAnswer()`.
- Admin API:
  - `GET /admin/model-channels`
  - `GET /admin/members`
  - `PATCH /admin/members/:id` with optional `{ modelChannelId?: string | null, status?: "ACTIVE" | "DISABLED" }`.
- Frontend:
  - `/assistant/admin` displays channel summaries and submits selected channel ids.

### 3. Contracts

- `ASSISTANT_MODEL_CHANNELS_JSON` accepts either an array or `{ "channels": [...] }`.
- Each channel item uses `{ id, label, provider, baseUrl, apiKey, model }` plus optional activation flags such as `isActive:false`, `active:false`, `enabled:false`, or `disabled:true`.
- Channel `id` must be a low-sensitive slug matching lowercase alphanumeric plus `_` / `-`; `default` is reserved for existing `ASSISTANT_MODEL_*`.
- API responses expose only `{ id, label, provider, model, configured, isDefault, isActive }`.
- API responses must never include `apiKey`, `baseUrl`, raw env JSON, endpoint URLs, request headers, or provider responses.
- Unknown or inactive channel ids fall back to the default channel for generation; admin assignment rejects unknown or inactive ids with a stable error.
- `UsageLog.modelChannelId` may store only the resolved low-sensitive channel id used for that call; it must not store endpoint URLs, keys, provider diagnostics, or raw channel JSON.
- Selecting the default channel may persist `null` so default routing remains environment-driven.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Missing admin token -> `401 { error: "missing-admin-token" }`.
- Missing database for member routes -> `503 { error: "database-not-configured" }`.
- Unknown member id -> `404 { error: "member-not-found" }`.
- Unknown `modelChannelId` in admin patch -> `400 { error: "unsupported-model-channel" }`.
- Unsupported member status -> `400 { error: "unsupported-member-status" }`.
- Assigned channel lacks a key/base/model -> `generateAnswer()` returns fallback with `reason: "not_configured"` and sanitized `modelChannel`.
- Assigned channel is inactive -> generation uses the default channel; if the default channel is also unavailable, the answer falls back with a sanitized default-channel summary.
- Provider failure for assigned channel -> fallback with sanitized diagnostic only.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: admin assigns member A to `mimo` and member B to `deepseek`; internal chat responses include model/provider/channel summaries but no endpoint or key.
- Good: production env rotates a provider key without touching member rows because only `modelChannelId` is stored.
- Base: no `ASSISTANT_MODEL_CHANNELS_JSON`; all members use the default `ASSISTANT_MODEL_*` channel or local fallback.
- Bad: storing per-member API keys or relay URLs in `Member`, `ChatMessage`, `UsageLog`, frontend state, or public docs.
- Bad: exposing raw `ASSISTANT_MODEL_CHANNELS_JSON` from `/health` or admin APIs.

### 6. Tests Required

- Run `npm.cmd run prisma:validate` and `npm.cmd run prisma:generate` after schema changes.
- Run `npm.cmd run server:build` after changing model-channel parsing, app routes, or types.
- Run `npm.cmd run server:smoke`; it must use only a local mock model server to assert channel selection and inactive-channel fallback to default.
- Run `npm.cmd run assistant:service-modes-smoke` after route additions to keep public/internal/rag/studio isolation.
- Run `npm.cmd run lint`, `npm.cmd run build`, and `npm.cmd run check:ui` after `/assistant/admin` or payload-normalizer changes.
- Sensitive scan changed files for real model keys, relay URLs, database URLs, member tokens, admin tokens, invite codes, and raw channel JSON.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```prisma
model Member {
  id             String @id @default(cuid())
  modelApiKey    String
  modelBaseUrl   String
  modelName      String
}
```

This puts provider secrets into application data and makes admin/member payloads easy to leak.

#### Correct

```prisma
model Member {
  id             String  @id @default(cuid())
  modelChannelId String?
}
```

```ts
await generateAnswer(question, citations, 'internal', {
  modelChannelId: member.modelChannelId,
})
```

The database stores only a safe channel id; the server resolves keys and endpoints from private environment variables.

## Scenario: Internal Assistant Session History

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: changing internal assistant member session APIs, `/assistant` history UI, chat persistence, `ChatSession`/`ChatMessage` serialization, or service-mode route isolation.
- Goal: let each internal member browse, create, continue, and archive only their own persisted sessions while keeping unauthenticated and no-database states low-sensitive and actionable.

### 2. Signatures

- Backend APIs:
  - `GET /chat/internal/sessions`
  - `POST /chat/internal/sessions`
  - `GET /chat/internal/sessions/:id/messages`
  - `PATCH /chat/internal/sessions/:id`
  - `POST /chat/internal` with optional `{ sessionId }`.
- Auth: all session routes require `Authorization: Bearer <member-token>`.
- DB:
  - `ChatSession.memberId` is the owner boundary.
  - `ChatSession.archivedAt` hides archived sessions from the default list.
  - `ChatSession.lastMessageAt` drives newest-first ordering.
- Frontend:
  - `src/data/assistant.ts` owns `normalizeAssistantSessionPreview()` and `normalizeAssistantMessages()`.
  - `/assistant` stores only the selected `sessionId` and member token in browser convenience storage.

### 3. Contracts

- Session list returns `{ sessions: AssistantSessionPreview[] }`, newest first, non-archived by default.
- Session previews expose only `{ id, title, preview, updatedAt, createdAt, archived, archivedAt }`.
- Message load returns `{ session, messages }`, where messages normalize to `{ id, role: "user" | "assistant", content, timestamp, citations, meta? }`.
- `ChatMessage.meta Json?` stores only sanitized assistant answer metadata: mode, model, provider, reason, safe model channel summary, citation count, retrieval summary, intent, and grounding.
- `ChatMessage.meta` must not store provider API keys, model base URLs, RAG URLs, Qdrant endpoints, raw provider responses, raw prompts, member tokens, admin tokens, or private source document text.
- Older messages may have `meta: null`; the UI must treat that as "no historical diagnostics", not as a broken message.
- `POST /chat/internal` must resolve `sessionId` with `findFirst({ where: { id: sessionId, memberId: member.id } })`; never attach a message to a session owned by another member.
- If `sessionId` is absent, internal chat creates a session for the authenticated member and returns its `sessionId`.
- Public, RAG, and Studio service modes must not mount internal session routes; internal mode mounts them but keeps them protected.
- Browser code must consume frontend normalizers instead of casting raw payloads inside route components.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Missing bearer token -> `401 { error: "missing-or-invalid-token" }`.
- Disabled member -> `403 { error: "member-disabled" }`.
- Present bearer token but no database -> `503 { error: "database-not-configured" }`.
- Unknown or cross-member session id -> `404 { error: "session-not-found" }`.
- Blank session title on rename -> `400 { error: "missing-title" }`.
- Malformed message/session payload in the browser -> drop invalid entries and show a low-sensitive degraded status.
- Malformed stored message `meta` -> serialize as `null`; do not throw or leak the raw JSON.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: member A sends with no `sessionId`; the API creates session A1, stores user/assistant messages, updates `lastMessageAt`, and the UI refreshes A's session list.
- Good: member A reloads A1 later; the latest assistant message still includes sanitized answer meta, so the right diagnostics panel can reconstruct model/channel/retrieval status.
- Good: member B requests A1 through `GET /chat/internal/sessions/:id/messages`; the API returns `session-not-found`, not A's messages.
- Base: no API base URL or no member token; `/assistant` keeps a clearly labeled local public-knowledge fallback.
- Base: a pre-migration assistant message has no `meta`; the conversation still renders and the diagnostics panel shows a waiting/no-history state.
- Bad: selecting a session by id with `findUnique({ where: { id } })` and then comparing owner in frontend.
- Bad: storing the provider diagnostic body, relay endpoint, raw prompt, or private retrieved chunk text in `ChatMessage.meta`.
- Bad: public mode exposes `/chat/internal/sessions` even though `/chat/internal` itself is hidden.

### 6. Tests Required

- Run `npm.cmd run server:build` after route or serializer changes.
- Run `npm.cmd run server:smoke`; it must assert session routes reject missing auth and report `database-not-configured` when a bearer token exists but persistence is absent.
- Run `npm.cmd run assistant:service-modes-smoke`; it must assert public/rag/studio do not expose session routes and internal exposes them only behind auth.
- Run `npm.cmd run prisma:validate` and `npm.cmd run prisma:generate` after adding or changing `ChatMessage.meta`.
- Run `npm.cmd run lint`, `npm.cmd run build`, and `npm.cmd run check:ui` after `/assistant` or payload-normalizer changes.
- Sensitive scan changed files for member tokens, admin tokens, invite codes, database URLs, model channels, raw session content from private users, and provider endpoints.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```ts
const session = await prisma.chatSession.findUnique({ where: { id: sessionId } })
await prisma.chatMessage.create({ data: { sessionId: session.id, memberId: member.id, content } })
```

This lets any valid session id become a cross-member attachment point.

#### Correct

```ts
const session = await prisma.chatSession.findFirst({
  where: { id: sessionId, memberId: member.id },
})
if (!session) return res.status(404).json({ error: 'session-not-found' })
```

The authenticated member id is part of the database query, so another member's session is indistinguishable from a missing session.

## Scenario: Internal Assistant Admin Controls

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: changing `/admin/summary`, `/admin/members`, `/admin/invites`, `/admin/usage`, `/assistant/admin`, invite revocation, member disable/enable, usage reporting, or assistant admin payload normalizers.
- Goal: give the owner an operational admin surface without exposing invite codes, invite hashes, member token hashes, admin tokens, model endpoints, or provider secrets.

### 2. Signatures

- Admin auth: every admin route requires `Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_TOKEN>`.
- APIs:
  - `GET /admin/summary`
  - `GET /admin/members`
  - `PATCH /admin/members/:id`
  - `GET /admin/invites`
  - `POST /admin/invites`
  - `PATCH /admin/invites/:id`
  - `GET /admin/usage`
- Frontend normalizers:
  - `normalizeAssistantMember()`
  - `normalizeAssistantInvite()`
  - `normalizeAssistantInvites()`
  - `normalizeAssistantModelChannels()`
  - `normalizeAssistantUsageSummaries()`

### 3. Contracts

- Invite list responses expose metadata only: `{ id, label, role, dailyQuota, maxUses, usedCount, status, expiresAt, revokedAt, createdAt }`.
- Invite list responses must never expose plaintext invite codes, `codeHash`, member tokens, token hashes, or raw authorization headers.
- Invite statuses are derived server-side as `OPEN`, `EXHAUSTED`, `EXPIRED`, or `REVOKED`.
- `PATCH /admin/invites/:id` accepts `{ revoked: boolean }` and stores only `revokedAt`.
- `PATCH /admin/members/:id` accepts `{ status?: "ACTIVE" | "DISABLED", modelChannelId?: string | null }`.
- Disabling a member sets `disabledAt`; enabling clears `disabledAt`.
- `GET /admin/usage` returns a bounded recent list with only `{ id, scope, model, tokensIn, tokensOut, createdAt, member }`, where `member` is a safe summary. It must not include prompts, answers, citations, bearer tokens, token hashes, invite hashes, provider endpoints, or raw request payloads.
- `/assistant/admin` should present owner operations as a workspace with clear sections/tabs for overview, invites, members, knowledge, usage, and safety boundaries. Avoid outdated MVP copy once the corresponding operations exist.
- `/assistant/admin` may store the admin token in local browser storage for convenience, but it must use `type="password"` and never render the token in status text.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Missing or mismatched admin token -> `401 { error: "missing-admin-token" }`.
- Valid admin token but no database -> `503 { error: "database-not-configured" }`.
- Unknown member -> `404 { error: "member-not-found" }`.
- Unsupported member status -> `400 { error: "unsupported-member-status" }`.
- Unknown invite -> `404 { error: "invite-not-found" }`.
- Non-boolean invite revocation payload -> `400 { error: "unsupported-invite-revocation" }`.
- Unknown model channel assignment -> `400 { error: "unsupported-model-channel" }`.
- Admin usage without database -> `503 { error: "database-not-configured" }`.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: owner refreshes invites, sees only labels/status/counts, and revokes an invite; future redemption fails because `revokedAt` is set.
- Good: owner disables a member; `/chat/internal`, `/me`, and session APIs reject that member with `member-disabled`.
- Good: owner opens the Usage tab and sees recent low-sensitive usage rows without any message content.
- Base: no database configured; admin UI explains the deployment gap without showing stack traces or env values.
- Bad: invite list includes `codeHash`, original plaintext code, bearer token, or a direct provider/base URL.
- Bad: usage rows include raw chat text, citation JSON, request bodies, token hashes, or model provider URLs.
- Bad: frontend constructs admin payloads from arbitrary objects without using assistant normalizers at the API boundary.

### 6. Tests Required

- Run `npm.cmd run server:build` after admin route changes.
- Run `npm.cmd run server:smoke`; it must assert admin routes reject missing admin token and report `database-not-configured` when a valid admin token is present but persistence is absent.
- Run `npm.cmd run assistant:service-modes-smoke`; it must assert admin invite routes are mounted only in internal/all mode.
- Run `npm.cmd run lint`, `npm.cmd run build`, and `npm.cmd run check:ui` after `/assistant/admin` or normalizer changes.
- Sensitive scan changed files for invite codes, `codeHash`, member tokens, admin tokens, database URLs, model channel endpoints, and provider keys.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```ts
res.json(await prisma.invite.findMany())
```

This leaks `codeHash` and makes future schema additions accidentally public.

#### Correct

```ts
const invites = await prisma.invite.findMany({ orderBy: { createdAt: 'desc' }, take: 100 })
res.json({ invites: invites.map(serializeInvite) })
```

`serializeInvite()` owns the public admin metadata contract and excludes all secret or hash fields.

## Scenario: Internal Knowledge Admin And Sync

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: changing `InternalKnowledgeDocument`, `InternalKnowledgeSyncRun`, `/admin/knowledge-*`, `/v1/sync` payloads, internal corpus sync, or `/assistant/admin` knowledge management.
- Goal: let the internal assistant maintain a curated internal corpus without exposing raw provider diagnostics, sync tokens, vector endpoints, or unreviewed/private content to public surfaces.

### 2. Signatures

- Prisma:
  - `InternalKnowledgeDocument`
  - `InternalKnowledgeSyncRun`
  - `InternalKnowledgeStatus = DRAFT | REVIEWED | ACTIVE | ARCHIVED`
  - `InternalKnowledgeSyncStatus = STARTED | COMPLETED | FAILED | SKIPPED`
- Internal admin APIs:
  - `GET /admin/knowledge-documents`
  - `POST /admin/knowledge-documents`
  - `PATCH /admin/knowledge-documents/:id`
  - `POST /admin/knowledge/sync`
- RAG API:
  - `POST /v1/sync` accepts optional `{ scope?: "public" | "internal", documents?: RagSyncDocument[] }`.

### 3. Contracts

- Internal knowledge documents contain `{ slug, title, summary, body, tags, status, sourceType, safetyNotes, contentHash, lastSyncedAt }`.
- Admin create/update requires at least a title and body.
- Only `REVIEWED` and `ACTIVE` documents are eligible for internal sync.
- `contentHash` is derived server-side from normalized public-safe fields; clients do not submit it.
- `POST /admin/knowledge/sync` records a sync run for every request, including skipped local plans.
- Missing `ASSISTANT_RAG_API_BASE_URL` or `RAG_SYNC_TOKEN` does not fail the admin UI; it records `SKIPPED` with low-sensitive reason `rag-sync-not-configured`.
- External sync diagnostics may include mode, scope, reason, accepted, counts, and numeric HTTP status only. They must not include RAG base URLs, sync tokens, embedding keys, Qdrant URLs, raw request bodies, raw responses, stack traces, or full document payloads.
- RAG `/v1/sync` must keep no-payload public sync behavior intact. `scope: "internal"` uses the internal documents payload and may return `local-readonly` diagnostics in local mode.
- When `RAG_STORE_PROVIDER=qdrant` is selected and Qdrant plus embedding config is complete, `scope: "internal"` sync writes chunk points only to `QDRANT_INTERNAL_COLLECTION`, using payload `visibility: "internal"` and `source: "internal-knowledge-documents"`.
- Qdrant internal sync must delete stale internal points for that source after a successful accepted sync, but public sync must continue deleting only public points in `QDRANT_PUBLIC_COLLECTION`.
- Qdrant internal sync diagnostics may include `scope: "internal"`, source name, source checksum, document/chunk counts, and issue count. They must not include chunk text, document body, provider endpoints, collection URLs, API keys, or raw provider responses.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Missing admin token -> `401 { error: "missing-admin-token" }`.
- Valid admin token but no database -> `503 { error: "database-not-configured" }`.
- Missing title/body -> `400 { error: "missing-knowledge-document-fields" }`.
- Duplicate slug -> `409 { error: "knowledge-slug-exists" }`.
- Unknown document id -> `404 { error: "knowledge-document-not-found" }`.
- Unsupported RAG sync scope -> `400 { error: "unsupported-scope" }`.
- No reviewed/active docs -> sync run status `SKIPPED`, reason `no-reviewed-internal-documents`.
- RAG sync not configured -> sync run status `SKIPPED`, reason `rag-sync-not-configured`.
- External RAG sync non-OK -> sync run status `FAILED`, reason `http_status`, numeric `httpStatus` only.
- External RAG returns `mode: "qdrant"` with `accepted: false` -> sync run status `FAILED`; `mode: "local-readonly"` with `accepted: false` -> sync run status `SKIPPED`.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: admin creates a `DRAFT`, reviews it, changes status to `REVIEWED`, and sync records document/chunk counts without leaking the body in diagnostics.
- Good: local development without RAG env can still create documents and record a skipped sync plan.
- Base: internal corpus is empty; sync records `SKIPPED` and internal chat can still use public/local fallback.
- Bad: browser sends RAG sync token or connects directly to `/v1/sync`.
- Bad: public assistant retrieve or public sync returns citations or chunks with internal visibility.
- Bad: sync diagnostic stores raw private document text, provider response bodies, Qdrant endpoint, database URL, or embedding key.

### 6. Tests Required

- Run `npm.cmd run prisma:validate` and `npm.cmd run prisma:generate` after schema changes.
- Run `npm.cmd run server:build` after route, type, or Prisma changes.
- Run `npm.cmd run server:smoke`; it must assert knowledge admin routes reject missing admin token and return `database-not-configured` when a valid admin token exists without persistence.
- Run `npm.cmd run assistant:service-modes-smoke`; public/rag/studio modes must not expose admin knowledge routes.
- Run `npm.cmd run assistant:rag-smoke`; it must assert internal sync payload returns low-sensitive local-readonly diagnostics without external credentials, and a local mock Qdrant path can accept internal sync, retrieve internal citations for internal scope, and avoid internal citations for public scope.
- Run `npm.cmd run assistant:rag-sync-local` after changing sync planning or knowledge mapping.
- Run `npm.cmd run lint`, `npm.cmd run build`, `npm.cmd run check:ui`, `git diff --check`, and sensitive scan before commit.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```ts
res.json(await fetch(`${ragBaseUrl}/v1/sync`, { body: JSON.stringify(req.body) }).then((item) => item.json()))
```

This forwards browser-shaped payloads directly to the RAG service and can leak sync configuration or raw provider diagnostics.

#### Correct

```ts
const documents = await prisma.internalKnowledgeDocument.findMany({
  where: { status: { in: ['REVIEWED', 'ACTIVE'] } },
})
const syncRun = await recordInternalSyncPlan(documents)
```

The internal API owns corpus selection, records sanitized diagnostics, and keeps the browser away from RAG credentials.

## Avoid

- Do not instantiate Prisma per request.
- Do not spread raw `req.body` into Prisma writes.
- Do not make lint pass by adding broad disables.
- Do not use destructive git commands or push without an explicit user request.

## Scenario: Assistant Service Modes And Scoped External RAG Stores

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: changing assistant backend runtime boundaries, Render deployment contracts, RAG Orchestrator auth/scope, external vector storage, sync, or retrieval code.
- Use this whenever editing `ASSISTANT_SERVICE_MODE`, `RAG_*`, `QDRANT_*`, `EMBEDDING_*`, `server/src/app.ts`, `server/src/ragRoutes.ts`, `server/src/ragOrchestrator.ts`, `server/src/ragQdrantStore.ts`, `server/src/ragPostgresStore.ts`, `server/sql/rag-store-pgvector.sql`, or related smoke scripts.

### 2. Signatures

- Runtime modes:
  - `ASSISTANT_SERVICE_MODE=public`
  - `ASSISTANT_SERVICE_MODE=internal`
  - `ASSISTANT_SERVICE_MODE=rag`
  - empty/unknown local default: `all`
- Public API mode:
  - `GET /health`
  - `POST /chat/public`
- Internal API mode:
  - `GET /health`
  - `POST /auth/redeem-invite`
  - `POST /chat/internal`
  - `GET /admin/summary`
  - `POST /admin/invites`
- RAG mode:
  - `GET /health`
  - `POST /v1/retrieve`
  - `POST /v1/sync`
- Local all mode keeps compatibility:
  - public/internal assistant routes at root
  - mock/local Orchestrator under `/rag/*`

### 3. Contracts

- Render final shape is one repository deployed as three Web Services:
  - `biau-public-assistant-api` with `ASSISTANT_SERVICE_MODE=public`.
  - `biau-internal-assistant-api` with `ASSISTANT_SERVICE_MODE=internal`.
  - `biau-rag-orchestrator` with `ASSISTANT_SERVICE_MODE=rag`.
- Public API must not mount internal/admin/RAG routes.
- Internal API must not mount public chat or RAG routes; internal chat remains member-token protected.
- RAG API must not mount chat/auth/admin routes.
- `POST /v1/retrieve` accepts `{ query: string, scope?: "public" | "internal", limit?: number, locale?: string }`.
- Public RAG key can retrieve only `scope: "public"`. Internal RAG key can retrieve only `scope: "internal"`.
- `POST /v1/sync` requires `RAG_SYNC_TOKEN` in standalone RAG mode.
- Final vector runtime uses `RAG_STORE_PROVIDER=qdrant` plus `QDRANT_URL`, `QDRANT_API_KEY`, `QDRANT_PUBLIC_COLLECTION`, `QDRANT_INTERNAL_COLLECTION`, `EMBEDDING_MODEL`, and `EMBEDDING_DIMENSION`.
- Supabase pgvector compatibility runtime may still use `RAG_STORE_PROVIDER=supabase` plus `RAG_DATABASE_URL`; `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` are server-only optional future-management variables.
- Public retrieval queries only `visibility='public'`; internal retrieval may query `visibility in ('public','internal')`.
- All keys, database URLs, provider URLs, and tokens are server-only and must not appear in `VITE_*`.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Missing `query` -> `400 { error: "missing-query" }`.
- Unsupported scope -> `400 { error: "unsupported-scope" }`.
- RAG mode retrieve without matching key -> `401 { error: "missing-or-invalid-rag-key" }`.
- RAG mode retrieve with no configured key for requested scope -> `503 { error: "rag-auth-not-configured" }`.
- RAG mode sync without matching sync token -> `401 { error: "missing-or-invalid-sync-token" }`.
- RAG mode sync with no configured sync token -> `503 { error: "rag-sync-not-configured" }`.
- Qdrant/Supabase store unset or unavailable in local/all mode -> use deterministic local retrieval for tests and safe fallback.
- Public mode request to `/chat/internal` or `/rag/health` -> route not mounted.
- Internal mode request to `/chat/public` or `/rag/health` -> route not mounted.
- RAG mode request to `/chat/public` -> route not mounted.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: `assistant:service-modes-smoke` proves each service mode exposes only its route group.
- Good: standalone RAG mode rejects a public key for `scope: "internal"`.
- Good: `assistant:rag-smoke` still validates local `/rag/*` contract without external credentials.
- Good: Qdrant config stays server-only and public scope queries only the public collection.
- Base: fresh clone with no `QDRANT_URL`, `QDRANT_API_KEY`, or `RAG_DATABASE_URL` still passes local deterministic checks.
- Bad: one Render service exposes public chat, internal admin, and RAG sync with the same secrets.
- Bad: frontend code reads `ASSISTANT_RAG_API_KEY`, `RAG_DATABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `EMBEDDING_API_KEY`, or `RAG_SYNC_TOKEN`.
- Bad: public retrieval returns a citation with `visibility: "internal"`.

### 6. Tests Required

- Run `npm.cmd run assistant:service-modes-smoke` after service mode or route-boundary changes.
- Run `npm.cmd run assistant:rag-smoke` after RAG route, auth, retrieval, or response-shape changes.
- Run `npm.cmd run assistant:rag-sync-local` after schema/sync/public-knowledge mapping changes.
- Run `npm.cmd run assistant:eval` after retrieval scoring, entity expansion, or citation behavior changes.
- Run `npm.cmd run server:build`, `npm.cmd run server:smoke`, `npm.cmd run cf-assistant:smoke`, `npm.cmd run lint`, `npm.cmd run build`, and `git diff --check`.
- Sensitive scan changed files for key/token/database URL patterns; only placeholders are acceptable.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```typescript
app.use('/rag', createRagOrchestratorRouter())
app.post('/chat/internal', internalChatHandler)
app.post('/chat/public', publicChatHandler)
```

This mounts every route in every production runtime, so public and internal secrets can accidentally share the same blast radius.

#### Correct

```typescript
if (env.assistantServiceMode === 'rag') {
  app.use(createRagOrchestratorRouter({ requireAuth: true }))
} else {
  if (env.assistantServiceMode === 'public') registerPublicAssistantRoutes(app)
  if (env.assistantServiceMode === 'internal') registerInternalAssistantRoutes(app)
}
```

Each Render service exposes only its own route group, while the repository can still share code and tests.

## Scenario: Public Assistant RAG Orchestrator Contract

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: adding or changing the public assistant RAG Orchestrator, retrieval contract, local/mock RAG adapter, external RAG adapter, vector/reranker adapter, or RAG health/sync endpoints.
- The Orchestrator is a server-side boundary. Frontend code must keep calling the existing assistant API shape and must never connect directly to vector stores, graph databases, embedding providers, reranker providers, or model relay URLs.

### 2. Signatures

- Current in-repo mock mount:
  - `GET /rag/health`
  - `POST /rag/v1/retrieve`
  - `POST /rag/v1/sync`
- Main-site adapter:
  - `POST /chat/public` calls `ASSISTANT_RAG_API_BASE_URL` only when configured.
  - `functions/api/chat/public.ts` follows the same contract through `functions/_shared/assistant.ts`.
- Standalone future mount:
  - `GET /health`
  - `POST /v1/retrieve`
  - `POST /v1/sync`
- `npm.cmd run assistant:rag-smoke` starts the local Express app and validates the mock Orchestrator contract without calling live models or cloud resources.
- `npm.cmd run assistant:rag-sync-local` validates that `server/data/public-knowledge-v2.json` can be mapped into the provider-neutral RAG store plan without external credentials.

### 3. Contracts

- Retrieve request: `{ query: string, scope?: "public", limit?: number, locale?: string }`.
- Missing or blank `query` -> `400 { error: "missing-query" }`.
- Non-public scope -> `400 { error: "unsupported-scope" }`.
- Retrieve response:
  - `intent`
  - `citations` in the same public citation shape used by `/chat/public`
  - `chunks` with `{ id, documentId, text, section, score, reason }`
  - `meta.retrievalMode`
  - `meta.store`
  - `meta.candidateCount`
  - `meta.reranked`
  - `meta.sufficient`
  - `meta.sufficiency`
  - `meta.fallbackReason`
  - `meta.citationCount`
  - `meta.expandedEntityCount`
  - `meta.modelCalls`
- Health response must stay low-sensitive: no provider endpoint, database URL, token fingerprint, table name, raw prompt, request body, or model relay detail.
- Local/mock sync is readonly and returns current knowledge counts; production sync tokens and external stores are manual-gated.
- Local deterministic embedding/vector/reranker adapters are allowed for stable tests, but they must be named as deterministic/local behavior and must not imply that an external vector store, embedding provider, or model reranker is configured.
- Public chat keeps the response shape `{ answer, citations, meta }`. Retrieval diagnostics live under `meta.retrieval` and may include `source`, `retrievalMode`, `store`, `candidateCount`, `citationCount`, `sufficiency`, `fallbackReason`, `modelCalls`, and sanitized `diagnostic`.
- Adapter diagnostics must not include endpoint URLs, API keys, database URLs, raw prompts, request bodies, vector table names, stack traces, or provider payloads. Use `httpStatusClass`, `attemptedEndpoints`, and `timeoutMs` instead of leaking exact URLs or response bodies.
- Storage templates may define `rag_documents`, `rag_chunks`, `rag_entities`, `rag_relations`, `rag_sync_runs`, and `rag_eval_runs`, but must not contain deployment-specific connection strings, hosts, credentials, model relay URLs, or private table names.
- Model answers for public chat must pass deterministic self-check before returning as `meta.mode: "model"`. If the answer prints raw routes, source logs, provider env names, database URLs, bearer tokens, or secret-looking values, return fallback with `meta.reason: "self_check_failed"`.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Valid public query -> `200` with citations, chunks, local retrieval diagnostics, and `modelCalls: 0`.
- Private credential request such as "后台密码" or "模型 key" -> `200` with no citations/chunks and `fallbackReason: "private-credential"`.
- Missing query -> `400 { error: "missing-query" }`.
- Unsupported scope -> `400 { error: "unsupported-scope" }`.
- External Orchestrator unavailable -> assistant must fall back to local Agentic Hybrid retrieval, not fail public chat. `meta.retrieval.source` should be `"local"` and `meta.retrieval.fallbackReason` should identify the sanitized adapter failure class such as `"network_error"`, `"timeout"`, `"http_status"`, or `"invalid_response"`.
- Vector/reranker unavailable in later phases -> Orchestrator must fall back to keyword/entity retrieval and deterministic rerank.
- Model answer fails deterministic self-check -> `200` fallback answer with `meta.reason: "self_check_failed"`; the unsafe text must not appear in `answer`.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: `/rag/v1/retrieve` for Legal RAG cites `project:legal-rag`, returns at least one chunk, marks `retrievalMode: "local-agentic-hybrid"`, and reports `modelCalls: 0`.
- Good: local/mock vector rerank can mark chunk reasons with `deterministic-vector`, while health still reports `store: "local"` and no provider details.
- Base: no external RAG env exists; local/mock Orchestrator still passes `assistant:rag-smoke`.
- Good: with a configured mock `ASSISTANT_RAG_API_BASE_URL`, `/chat/public` uses Orchestrator citations/chunks for grounding while still returning only public citation cards to the browser.
- Bad: a route logs raw chat questions, request bodies, API keys, model provider URLs, database URLs, vector table names, or stack traces.
- Bad: a browser bundle reads `ASSISTANT_RAG_API_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, embedding keys, reranker keys, or direct vector database URLs.

### 6. Tests Required

- Run `npm.cmd run assistant:rag-smoke` after Orchestrator contract changes.
- Run `npm.cmd run assistant:rag-sync-local` after changing public knowledge V2, storage schemas, or sync planning.
- Run `npm.cmd run assistant:eval` to keep the fixed public-question baseline green.
- Run `npm.cmd run server:smoke` to prove existing `/chat/public`, model fallback, mock Orchestrator success/fallback, and protected internal routes still work.
- Run `npm.cmd run cf-assistant:smoke` when Cloudflare Function behavior or shared public assistant retrieval changes; it should cover mock Orchestrator success/fallback without calling live providers.
- Run `npm.cmd run server:build`, `npm.cmd run lint`, `npm.cmd run build`, `git diff --check`, and a sensitive scan over changed files.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```typescript
app.post('/v1/retrieve', async (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.body)
  const result = await fetch(`${process.env.SUPABASE_URL}/rest/v1/chunks`, {
    headers: { apikey: process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY ?? '' },
  })
  res.json(await result.json())
})
```

This leaks request bodies into logs, couples the route directly to one storage provider, and risks exposing provider-shaped payloads.

#### Correct

```typescript
router.post('/v1/retrieve', (req, res) => {
  const query = typeof req.body?.query === 'string' ? req.body.query.trim() : ''
  if (!query) {
    res.status(400).json({ error: 'missing-query' })
    return
  }
  res.json(retrieveRagContext({ query, scope: 'public' }))
})
```

The route validates public input, delegates retrieval to the Orchestrator boundary, and returns only the stable public contract.
