# Blog Content Pipeline

Use this skill to produce polished public blog content without turning the site into an automated SEO farm. Treat every committed article as public.

## Core Rule

Never let a model invent project facts, deployment status, metrics, screenshots, customer names, secrets, private URLs, API keys, local paths, or production infrastructure details.

## Start With A Mode Gate

Before planning, drafting, rewriting, or reviewing a post, explicitly choose and
record the writing mode:

1. **Codex-only scaffold/review** — use repository evidence and scripts without
   model generation. Record `model channel: none` in the evidence pack. Do not
   force model setup for this mode.
2. **Model-assisted draft/rewrite** — ask the user to set or confirm the model
   profiles before generation. Prefer the smart-search-style guided setup:
   `npm.cmd run blog:model -- setup`, then masked offline
   `npm.cmd run blog:model -- status --all --format markdown` and
   `npm.cmd run blog:model -- doctor --all --format markdown`. If a profile
   resolves through fallback or legacy values, surface that and recommend setup
   before generation.
3. **Review-only** — review an existing draft against evidence, safety, column
   fit, overlap, voice, image, and promotion gates. Record any missing model
   setup only if generation is requested.
4. **Publish reviewed content** — only after review passes, update runtime blog
   data and public indexes.

Do not run `doctor --live`, `blog:draft -- --generate`, or any other live model
request unless the user explicitly approves that small model task.

## Route The Task

- **Plan or draft a new post**: start with the mode gate, read `src/data/blogShared.ts`, then read `references/templates.md` for the target column. Use `npm.cmd run blog:plan` and `npm.cmd run blog:draft -- --slug <slug> --force` when the topic exists in `scripts/blog-rewrite-plan.json`.
- **Rewrite a legacy post**: read `content-archive/legacy-blog/rewrite-queue.json`, then inspect the archived source under `content-archive/legacy-blog/posts/`. Treat it as raw material only; rebuild evidence before drafting.
- **Review an existing draft**: read the draft in `content-drafts/`, then use `references/review-and-prompts.md` for fact, safety, structure, and promotion gates.
- **Publish reviewed content**: update typed runtime data only after review: `src/data/blog.ts`, `src/data/blog-posts/<slug>.ts`, `src/data/blogContent.ts`, and `src/data/blogCuration.ts` as needed.
- **Set up or reuse the skill**: read `references/usage.md` for installation/sync notes, model profile configuration, commands, and image generation policy.

## Evidence Pack First

Before drafting, capture:

- target column and intended reader
- source paths or URLs read
- exact facts safe to publish
- uncertain or stale facts
- forbidden/private details
- project-page overlap risk
- writing mode
- intended model strategy
- selected model channel, or `none` for Codex-only mode

For project-related posts, do not rely only on README files. Read code, public project data, tests, deployment scripts, screenshots, Trellis task notes, and existing project pages.

For image decisions, read `references/usage.md`. Prefer real screenshots and diagrams for evidence; use generated images only for covers or abstract illustrations that are clearly not product evidence.

## Model Channels

Default important-post strategy:

```text
Codex evidence pack -> Codex scaffold -> strong profile draft -> review profile polish -> Codex final fact/safety review
```

- Evidence, comparison, final safety, and ingestion: Codex owns the evidence
  pack, compares generated text against facts, fuses usable parts, and rejects
  unsupported claims.
- Long-form drafting or rewriting: use the `strong` profile, recommended
  GLM-5.2 or Gemini 3.1 Pro, or an equivalent configured channel.
- Polishing: use the `review` profile, recommended DeepSeek V4 Pro, for
  structure, tone, density, and lower AI-smell rewrites; do not treat model
  review as authority.
- Outlines, summaries, titles, or low-risk batch checks: use the `fast` profile,
  recommended Gemini 3.5 Flash or equivalent low-cost model.
- Single-profile generation is acceptable for small or low-risk drafts; use the
  staged flow for important posts, style uncertainty, or disputed framing.
- Default to serial calls. If parallel model use is necessary, split across different relays or provider profiles.
- Each profile may have optional same-profile fallback channels, for example
  `BLOG_DRAFT_REVIEW_FALLBACK_1_*`. During real draft or polish generation, the
  script may try `primary -> fallback-1 -> fallback-2` serially after a channel
  failure. Fallback never crosses roles: `review` fallback channels stay under
  `review`, and do not silently switch to `strong` or `fast`.
- Namespaced relay model IDs such as `deepseek-ai/deepseek-v4-pro` should be
  compared by their canonical model ID, so they are treated as equivalent to
  `deepseek-v4-pro` when the final segment matches.
- Use `npm.cmd run blog:model -- setup --profile <profile> --fallback` to add
  a fallback channel later. `status` and default `doctor` must show fallback
  readiness with masked base URL/API-key status only.
- Store real relay URLs and API keys only in `.env.local` or external configuration. Public repo files may contain placeholders only.

Draft generation uses OpenAI-compatible chat completions. Prefer named `BLOG_DRAFT_*` profiles; old `GEMINI_*` variables remain fallback:

```text
BLOG_DRAFT_PROFILE=strong
BLOG_DRAFT_BASE_URL=
BLOG_DRAFT_API_KEY=
BLOG_DRAFT_MODEL=
BLOG_DRAFT_PROVIDER=
BLOG_DRAFT_TEMPERATURE=0.65

BLOG_DRAFT_STRONG_BASE_URL=
BLOG_DRAFT_STRONG_API_KEY=
BLOG_DRAFT_STRONG_MODEL=
BLOG_DRAFT_STRONG_PROVIDER=
BLOG_DRAFT_STRONG_TEMPERATURE=0.65

BLOG_DRAFT_FAST_BASE_URL=
BLOG_DRAFT_FAST_API_KEY=
BLOG_DRAFT_FAST_MODEL=
BLOG_DRAFT_FAST_PROVIDER=
BLOG_DRAFT_FAST_TEMPERATURE=0.35

BLOG_DRAFT_REVIEW_BASE_URL=
BLOG_DRAFT_REVIEW_API_KEY=
BLOG_DRAFT_REVIEW_MODEL=
BLOG_DRAFT_REVIEW_PROVIDER=
BLOG_DRAFT_REVIEW_TEMPERATURE=0.2

BLOG_DRAFT_REVIEW_FALLBACK_1_BASE_URL=
BLOG_DRAFT_REVIEW_FALLBACK_1_API_KEY=
BLOG_DRAFT_REVIEW_FALLBACK_1_MODEL=
BLOG_DRAFT_REVIEW_FALLBACK_1_PROVIDER=
BLOG_DRAFT_REVIEW_FALLBACK_1_TEMPERATURE=0.2
```

Use `npm.cmd run blog:model -- setup` for guided three-profile setup, or
`npm.cmd run blog:model -- setup --profile <profile>` for one profile. Use
`npm.cmd run blog:draft -- --slug <slug> --force --generate --profile strong`
for the first model draft only after setup and approval. Use
`npm.cmd run blog:draft -- --slug <slug> --polish-from content-drafts/<file>.md --profile review`
when a review/polish pass should rewrite the existing `## Draft Body` while
preserving the evidence scaffold. If a named profile is missing a value, the
script falls back to the default `BLOG_DRAFT_*` channel, then legacy
`GEMINI_*`, and the workflow must surface that as a setup gap.

Do not run `blog:draft -- --generate` unless the run is explicitly
`model-assisted`, the evidence pack is complete, a private model channel is
intentionally configured, and the user has approved the generation step.

For setup details and profile examples, read `references/usage.md`.

## Draft Shape

Prefer Markdown or structured notes during drafting, then convert reviewed content into the typed `BlogPost` shape. Keep title, detail, sections, takeaways, knowledge points, and tags concrete.

Avoid generic AI prose, resume/interview tone, learning-day framing, empty listicles, and public claims that are not supported by the evidence pack.

## Review Gates

Read `references/review-and-prompts.md` when drafting with a model, reviewing a draft, or promoting content.

Minimum gates:

- every factual claim is backed by evidence
- no private or sensitive information is included
- the post does not duplicate a project detail page
- the column matches the article purpose
- legacy source material has been rewritten, not copied directly
- hidden drafts remain hidden unless explicitly curated
- images are safe, source-labeled, and not misleading

## Publish Or Stage

Stage drafts under `content-drafts/`. Public posts must go through `blogCuration` and public selectors.

For public visibility or tag changes, run:

```powershell
npm.cmd run blog:audit
npm.cmd run blog:check
npm.cmd run assistant:index
npm.cmd run sitemap:generate
npm.cmd run lint
npm.cmd run build
```

Attempt `npm.cmd run verify` for broad blog, assistant, or UI changes.
