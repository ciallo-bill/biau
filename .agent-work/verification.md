Task: Add Pet Workspace public-safe admin-review runtime screenshot

## Diff Summary

- Added one Pet Workspace admin-review runtime screenshot:
  - public/images/projects/showcase/fantasy-pet-admin-review-runtime.png
- Updated `src/App.tsx` so `/cases/pet-workspace` includes the new evidence card.
- Updated `docs/showcase-assets.md` to mark the Pet Workspace admin-review screenshot gap as covered.
- Archived the previous Ozon ERP workflow artifacts.
- Updated current workflow artifacts for the Pet Workspace slice.

## Capture Evidence

- Source project was copied into a temporary capture directory before running.
- Reference/source Pet paths were kept read-only.
- Only `gamer/apps/admin-review/server.js` was run from the temporary copy.
- No real community API, pet-generator worker, database, Supabase, Android app, cloud service, or deployment script was started.
- A temporary GA run root was created with demo candidate metadata and generated placeholder preview/motion images.
- Browser automation intercepted unrelated community API routes with empty public-safe responses.
- The selected screenshot shows the real admin-review UI with GA candidate cards, review metrics, preview images, motion checks, feedback controls, and rework queue indicators.

## Commands Run

| Command | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| npm ci --ignore-scripts in temporary gamer copy | pass | Installed capture-only dependencies without running project scripts. |
| admin-review server from temporary copy | pass | Used only for screenshot capture with demo GA run root. |
| file public/images/projects/showcase/fantasy-pet-admin-review-runtime.png | pass | PNG image data, 1440 x 900, RGB. |
| sensitive/public wording scan | reviewed | Public source/docs changes do not contain real task data, run paths, model config, cloud endpoints, storage keys, local paths, credentials, or non-product positioning wording. |
| npm run lint | pass | ESLint completed without errors in WSL. |
| npm run build | pass | TypeScript and Vite build completed. Existing lottie-web direct eval warning remains from dependency code. |
| Browser QA with system Chrome | pass | `/cases/pet-workspace` checked at 1440x900 and 390x844 against the local dev server. The new PNG decodes at 1440x900, no console errors, no failed requests, no horizontal overflow, and no sensitive/non-product wording. |

## Public-Safety Review

- Screenshot uses demo candidate names, generated placeholder images, demo state/claim values, and redacted metadata.
- Screenshot does not show real task JSON, source run directories, model settings, prompts, storage keys, cloud endpoints, candidate packages, local validation paths, or private assets.
- The capture page was the real admin-review runtime, but all candidate and backend data was temporary and public-safe.
- The Pet Workspace gap is now closed in `docs/showcase-assets.md`.

## Remaining Steps

- Commit and push this slice.
- After Cloudflare Pages deploys, verify:
  - Direct PNG asset returns 200.
  - Production `/cases/pet-workspace` loads the new evidence card on desktop and mobile.
