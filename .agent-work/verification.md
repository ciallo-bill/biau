Task: Add Next Spacewar real runtime screenshots

## Diff Summary

- Added two real Next Spacewar runtime screenshots generated from a temporary copy of the actual Godot project:
  - public/images/projects/showcase/next-spacewar-menu.png
  - public/images/projects/showcase/next-spacewar-gameplay.png
- Updated src/data/portfolio.ts so the Next Spacewar project uses the real main-menu screenshot as its visual asset.
- Updated src/App.tsx so /cases/godot-showcase includes Next Spacewar main-menu and gameplay-HUD evidence alongside the structure diagram.
- Updated docs/showcase-assets.md to mark Next Spacewar runtime screenshots as covered and leave InteSpace/Raiden as future gaps.
- Updated .agent-work/current-task.md for this implementation slice.

## Screenshot Generation Evidence

- Source project: D:/workspace4Codex/game-next-spacewar, copied to D:/workspace4Codex/.tmp-godot-capture/game-next-spacewar.
- Runtime: Godot 4.6.1 stable Windows console binary.
- Script: temporary showcase capture runner under scripts/tools in the capture copy.
- Selected public images:
  - next-spacewar-menu.png: 1280 x 720, main menu runtime.
  - next-spacewar-gameplay.png: 1280 x 720, gameplay HUD runtime.
- Capture produced non-fatal font/theme warnings for a missing local CJK font resource, but the selected screenshots render correctly.
- No source project files under ~/workspace/reference-projects or D:/workspace4Codex/game-next-spacewar were modified.

| Route | Viewport | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| /projects/game-next-spacewar | 1440x900 and 390x844 | pass | Page loads h1 太空战机｜展示构建 and next-spacewar-menu.png at 1280x720; no console errors, no horizontal overflow, no 面试/作品集 wording. |
| /games/next-spacewar | 1440x900 and 390x844 | pass | Game detail loads h1 太空战机｜展示构建 and next-spacewar-menu.png at 1280x720; no console errors, no horizontal overflow, no 面试/作品集 wording. |
| /cases/godot-showcase | 1440x900 and 390x844 | pass | Case route loads 11 images. After scrolling lazy content, next-spacewar-menu.png and next-spacewar-gameplay.png both decode at 1280x720; no console errors, no horizontal overflow. |

## Commands Run

| Command | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| file public/images/projects/showcase/next-spacewar-*.png | pass | Confirmed both PNG files are 1280 x 720. |
| npm run lint | pass | ESLint completed without errors in WSL. |
| npm run build | pass | TypeScript and Vite build completed in WSL. Existing lottie-web direct eval warning remains from dependency code. |
| sensitive/public wording scan | reviewed | Hits are this verification file safety wording, CSS numeric false positives, or SVG coordinates; no real account, endpoint, credential, database URL, host, or public interview/portfolio wording was introduced. |
| Browser QA | pass | Verified /projects/game-next-spacewar, /games/next-spacewar, and /cases/godot-showcase at desktop and mobile widths. |

## Public-Safety Review

- The selected screenshots show only game UI, gameplay state, generic menu text, and showcase version information.
- No local paths, accounts, tokens, IPs, domains, logs, release package names, or generated .import metadata were published.
- The full capture output remains in the temporary capture directory and was not copied into the site.
- Next Spacewar now has main-menu and gameplay runtime evidence; InteSpace and Raiden still need real runtime screenshots in later slices.

## Ship Decision

Ready to commit and push after final git diff review.
