Task: Public wording and status consistency cleanup

## Provider / Workflow

- Provider order was followed for CC planning.
- `a` was attempted first but returned a generic clarification instead of a usable plan.
- `b` produced a valid read-only plan and was used as builder input.
- Codex narrowed the plan before implementation in `.agent-work/codex-review.md`.

## Code Review Summary

- Updated stale case statuses from `补充中` to `整理中` after evidence/screenshots were added.
- Removed stale public next-step wording such as “补充脱敏后台截图” and “补充脱敏移动端截图”.
- Rephrased Space War public copy so it says the site-level showcase route exists while the real Godot Web package remains a future integration.
- Avoided layout, route, project list, and reference-project changes.

## Scans

- Stale public wording scan over `src/App.tsx`, `src/data/portfolio.ts`, and `docs/showcase-assets.md` returned no public-file matches for:
  - `补充中`
  - `补充截图`
  - `补充脱敏`
  - `接入 Web 试玩入口`
  - `后续补充`
  - `面试`
- Sensitive/private scan returned only false positives for normal TypeScript identifiers containing `id`; no private paths, local service addresses, credentials, secrets, or tokens were found in changed public files.

## Commands

| Command | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `npm run lint` | pass | ESLint completed successfully. |
| `npm run build` | pass | Build completed successfully. Existing `lottie-web` direct eval warning remains from dependency code. |

## Local Browser QA

System Chrome was used through Playwright because the bundled Playwright Chromium cache was not installed.

## Deployment QA

Source commit:

- `e9fdedd Clean up public showcase wording`

Cloudflare deployment was confirmed by rendering `https://biau.playlab.eu.cc/games/space-war` and checking that the new Space War phrase `真实 Godot Web 包后续单独接入` was present while the old phrase `后续重点是把 Web 试玩入口接入本站` was absent.
