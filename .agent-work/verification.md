Task: Remove unused draft article data and pending status

## Provider / Workflow

- Previous task artifacts were archived.
- Provider selection used short smoke tests before the long planning prompt:
  - `a`: timed out after 20s with no output.
  - `b`: returned in 14s but ignored the strict `OK` instruction; long prompt produced a generic greeting and was rejected.
  - `c`: timed out after 20s with no output.
  - `d`: returned in 10s with verbose output and then produced the accepted read-only plan.
- Codex narrowed the plan in `.agent-work/codex-review.md`.

## Pre-Edit Evidence

- `articles` was exported from `src/data/portfolio.ts` but was not imported or rendered anywhere in `src`.
- No project used `status: 'pending'`.
- `pending` existed only in `ProjectStatus`, `statusLabels`, and two UI color branches.

## Code Review Summary

- Removed the unused `articles` export from `src/data/portfolio.ts`.
- Removed `pending` from `ProjectStatus` and `statusLabels`.
- Simplified the two project status color branches in `src/App.tsx`.
- Did not change visible project content, active project statuses, routes, screenshots, or styles.

## Scans

- Targeted scan over `src/App.tsx` and `src/data/portfolio.ts` returned no matches for:
  - `articles`
  - `pending`
  - `待补图`
  - `待整理`
- Sensitive/private scan returned only false positives for normal TypeScript identifiers containing `id`; no private paths, local service addresses, credentials, secrets, or tokens were found in changed public files.
