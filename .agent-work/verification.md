Task: Add Tetris real runtime screenshots

## Diff Summary

- Added two real Tetris runtime screenshots generated from the actual Godot project:
  - public/images/projects/showcase/tetris-classic-desktop.png
  - public/images/projects/showcase/tetris-mobile-menu.png
- Updated src/data/portfolio.ts so the Tetris project uses the real desktop runtime screenshot as its visual asset.
- Updated src/App.tsx so /cases/godot-showcase includes Tetris desktop runtime and mobile menu evidence alongside the structure diagram.
- Updated docs/showcase-assets.md to distinguish Tetris real screenshots from the remaining Godot structure diagrams.
- Updated .agent-work/current-task.md for this implementation slice.

## Screenshot Generation Evidence

- Source project: D:/workspace4Codex/game-first-tetris, copied to /tmp/godot-capture/game-first-tetris.
- Runtime: Godot 4.6.1 stable Linux binary installed under ~/tools/godot.
- Script: scripts/tools/screenshot_regression_runner.gd from the project.
- Output: 36 PNG screenshots under /tmp/godot-capture/game-first-tetris/artifacts/screenshot_regression.
- Selected public images:
  - tetris-classic-desktop.png: 1280 x 720, 45 KB, classic mode desktop runtime.
  - tetris-mobile-menu.png: 393 x 852, 44 KB, Android-size vertical main menu runtime.
- No source project files under ~/workspace/reference-projects or D:/workspace4Codex/game-first-tetris were modified.

| Route | Viewport | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| /projects | 1440x900 and 390x844 | pass | Page loads with h1 项目系统, no console errors, no horizontal overflow. |
| /projects/game-first-tetris | 1440x900 and 390x844 | pass | Tetris detail loads tetris-classic-desktop.png at 1280x720, no console errors, no horizontal overflow. |
| /games/first-tetris | 1440x900 and 390x844 | pass | Game route loads tetris-classic-desktop.png at 1280x720, no console errors, no horizontal overflow. |
| /cases/godot-showcase | 1440x900 and 390x844 | pass | Case route loads 9 images, including tetris-classic-desktop.png, tetris-mobile-menu.png, and godot-tetris-structure.svg; no console errors, no horizontal overflow. |

## Commands Run

| Command | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Godot screenshot regression script | partial-pass | Script generated the expected screenshot set but did not exit before the 180s command timeout; the leftover process was stopped after confirming output. |
| file public/images/projects/showcase/tetris-*.png | pass | Confirmed 1280x720 and 393x852 PNG dimensions. |
| npm run lint | pass | ESLint completed without errors in WSL. |
| npm run build | pass | TypeScript and Vite build completed in WSL. Existing lottie-web direct eval warning remains from dependency code. |
| sensitive/public wording scan | reviewed | Hits are previous audit notes, CSS numeric false positives, or SVG coordinates; no real account, endpoint, credential, database URL, host, or public interview/portfolio wording was introduced. |

## Public-Safety Review

- The selected screenshots show only game UI, gameplay state, and generic menu text.
- No local paths, accounts, tokens, IPs, domains, logs, release package names, or generated .import metadata were published.
- Full screenshot regression output remains local under /tmp and was not copied into the site.
- Tetris now has real runtime evidence; Next Spacewar, InteSpace, and Raiden still need real runtime screenshots in later slices.

## Ship Decision

Ready to commit and push after final git status review.
