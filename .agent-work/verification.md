Task: Add Next Spacewar result-page screenshot

## Diff Summary

- Added one Next Spacewar closed-loop UI screenshot generated from a temporary copy of the actual Godot project:
  - public/images/projects/showcase/next-spacewar-result-summary.png
- Updated src/App.tsx so /cases/godot-showcase includes Next Spacewar result-page evidence.
- Updated docs/showcase-assets.md to mark Next Spacewar result-page coverage while leaving InteSpace result-page screenshots as a future gap.
- Updated .agent-work/current-task.md, .agent-work/cc-plan.md, and .agent-work/codex-review.md for this implementation slice.

## Screenshot Generation Evidence

- Source project: D:/workspace4Codex/game-next-spacewar, captured through the temporary project at D:/workspace4Codex/.tmp-godot-capture/game-next-spacewar.
- Runtime: Godot 4.6.1 stable Windows console binary.
- Runner: temporary script under scripts/tools in the capture copy.
- The runner seeded a public-safe run-complete state, then captured the actual RunResult UI.
- Selected public image:
  - next-spacewar-result-summary.png: 1280 x 720, result-page review UI.
- No source project files under ~/workspace/reference-projects or D:/workspace4Codex/game-next-spacewar were modified.

## Local Browser QA

Base URL: http://127.0.0.1:5175

| Route | Viewport | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| /cases/godot-showcase | 1440x900 and 390x844 | pass | Case route loads 19 images. next-spacewar-result-summary.png decodes at natural size 1280x720 after lazy-load scroll; no console errors, no failed requests, no horizontal overflow, no non-product positioning wording. |

## Commands Run

| Command | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Godot 4.6.1 capture runner | pass | Windowed run generated result-summary.png. Headless run could not capture a viewport image because dummy rendering returned an empty texture. |
| file public/images/projects/showcase/next-spacewar-result-summary.png | pass | Confirmed PNG file is 1280 x 720. |
| npm run lint | pass | ESLint completed without errors in WSL. |
| npm run build | pass | TypeScript and Vite build completed in WSL. Existing lottie-web direct eval warning remains from dependency code. |
| sensitive/public wording scan | reviewed | Hits are limited to workflow safety constraints and existing numeric SVG coordinates/CSS values; no public source, docs, or asset path introduced real accounts, endpoints, credentials, hosts, or non-product positioning. |
| Playwright QA with Windows Chrome | pass | Verified /cases/godot-showcase at desktop and mobile widths against the WSL dev server. |

## Public-Safety Review

- The selected screenshot shows only Next Spacewar result-page UI, public-safe run-complete state text, target count, summary copy, replay/menu buttons, and a generic showcase build label.
- The values are seeded demonstration state for public-safe UI capture; they are not presented as raw player telemetry, real user data, or production logs.
- No local paths, accounts, tokens, IPs, domains, logs, release package names, Godot .import metadata, or generated validation output were published.
- The temporary capture script and full capture output remain in the temporary capture directory and were not copied into the site.
- Next Spacewar now has menu, gameplay HUD, result-page, and flow-diagram evidence; InteSpace result-page screenshots remain a later gap.

## Ship Decision

Ready to commit and push after final git diff review.
