Task: Add InteSpace real runtime screenshots

## Diff Summary

- Added two real InteSpace runtime screenshots generated from a temporary copy of the actual Godot project:
  - public/images/projects/showcase/intespace-player-hub.png
  - public/images/projects/showcase/intespace-gameplay-hud.png
- Updated src/data/portfolio.ts so the InteSpace project uses the real player-hub screenshot as its visual asset.
- Updated src/App.tsx so /cases/godot-showcase includes InteSpace player-hub and gameplay-HUD runtime evidence alongside the existing system-loop diagram.
- Updated docs/showcase-assets.md to mark InteSpace runtime screenshots as covered while leaving Raiden and result-page gaps for later slices.
- Updated .agent-work/current-task.md for this implementation slice.

## Screenshot Generation Evidence

- Source project: D:/workspace4Codex/intespace, copied to D:/workspace4Codex/.tmp-godot-capture/intespace-20260616.
- Runtime: Godot 4.6.1 stable Windows console binary.
- Runner: temporary Node scene and script under scenes/tools and scripts/tools in the capture copy.
- Selected public images:
  - intespace-player-hub.png: 540 x 960, player hub/runtime launch state.
  - intespace-gameplay-hud.png: 540 x 960, gameplay HUD/runtime combat state.
- The result-loop capture path produced a nonfatal game-script issue in the temporary copy, so no result screenshot was published in this slice.
- No source project files under ~/workspace/reference-projects or D:/workspace4Codex/intespace were modified.

| Route | Viewport | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| /projects/intespace | 1440x900 and 390x844 | pass | Page loads h1 竖屏肉鸽射击｜intespace and intespace-player-hub.png at natural size 540x960; no console errors, no failed requests, no horizontal overflow, no 面试/作品集 wording. |
| /games/intespace | 1440x900 and 390x844 | pass | Game detail loads h1 竖屏肉鸽射击｜intespace and intespace-player-hub.png at natural size 540x960; no console errors, no failed requests, no horizontal overflow, no 面试/作品集 wording. |
| /cases/godot-showcase | 1440x900 and 390x844 | pass | Case route loads 13 images. InteSpace player-hub and gameplay-HUD PNGs both decode at natural size 540x960; no console errors, no failed requests, no horizontal overflow, no 面试/作品集 wording. |

## Commands Run

| Command | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| file public/images/projects/showcase/intespace-*.png | pass | Confirmed both PNG files are 540 x 960. |
| npm run lint | pass | ESLint completed without errors in WSL. |
| npm run build | pass | TypeScript and Vite build completed in WSL. Existing lottie-web direct eval warning remains from dependency code. |
| sensitive/public wording scan | reviewed | Hits are limited to this verification file describing the safety check itself; no source, docs, public asset path, or task scope introduced real accounts, endpoints, credentials, hosts, or public interview/portfolio positioning. |
| Playwright QA with Windows Chrome | pass | Verified /projects/intespace, /games/intespace, and /cases/godot-showcase at desktop and mobile widths against the WSL dev server. |

## Public-Safety Review

- The selected screenshots show only game UI, player hub state, gameplay HUD, route progress, player/enemy visuals, and generic runtime state.
- No local paths, accounts, tokens, IPs, domains, logs, release package names, Godot .import metadata, or generated validation output were published.
- The full capture output remains in the temporary capture directory and was not copied into the site.
- InteSpace now has player-hub and gameplay runtime evidence; Raiden still needs real runtime screenshots in a later slice.

Ready to commit and push.
