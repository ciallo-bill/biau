Task: Add Godot game showcase diagrams

## Diff Summary

- Added four public-safe SVG diagrams for Tetris, Next Spacewar, InteSpace, and Raiden Prototype.
- Added those diagrams as visual assets for the matching interactive projects in src/data/portfolio.ts.
- Expanded the Godot showcase case detail page from Space War-only evidence to a five-project evidence matrix.
- Updated docs/showcase-assets.md so the inventory reflects the new game coverage and remaining real-screenshot gap.
- Updated .agent-work/current-task.md for this implementation slice.

## New Public Assets

| /games/first-tetris | 1440x900 and 390x844 | pass | Tetris route loads its new SVG image; no console errors or horizontal overflow. |

## Commands Run

| Command | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| npm run lint | pass | ESLint completed without errors in WSL. |
| npm run build | pass | TypeScript and Vite build completed in WSL. Existing lottie-web direct eval warning remains from dependency code. |
| sensitive/public wording scan | reviewed | Hits are active audit records, CSS numeric false positives, or SVG coordinates; no real account, endpoint, credential, database URL, host, or public interview/portfolio wording was introduced. |

## Public-Safety Review

- The four new SVGs are explicitly structure/path diagrams, not real runtime screenshots.
- No project source directories under ~/workspace/reference-projects were modified.
- No real IPs, domains, accounts, credentials, database URLs, signing paths, local validation paths, deployment records, package hashes, raw logs, task JSON, or release package details were copied into public content.
- The remaining asset gap is real gameplay/result screenshots for the non-Space War Godot projects, which should be added later only after review and desensitization.

## Ship Decision

Committed and pushed: 081871d Add-Godot-showcase-diagrams.
