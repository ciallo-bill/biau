Task: Add InteSpace result/summary screenshot

## Diff Summary

- Added one InteSpace result/summary screenshot generated from a temporary copy of the actual Godot project:
  - public/images/projects/showcase/intespace-result-summary.png
- Updated src/App.tsx so /cases/godot-showcase includes InteSpace result/summary evidence.
- Updated docs/showcase-assets.md to mark InteSpace result-page coverage as complete.
- Updated .agent-work/verification.md for this implementation slice.

## Screenshot Generation Evidence

- Source project: D:/workspace4Codex/intespace, captured through the temporary project at D:/workspace4Codex/.tmp-godot-capture/intespace-20260616.
- Runtime: Godot 4.6.1 stable Windows console binary.
- Runner: temporary script under the capture copy.
- The runner called the real `_finish_run(true)` method in `scripts/game/game_root.gd` to trigger the actual end-of-run overlay built by `_build_end_overlay()`.
- A minimal compatibility method `get_mode_protocol_post_run_text()` was added to the capture copy to allow the existing result overlay to render route text without aborting.
- Selected public image:
  - intespace-result-summary.png: 540 x 960, result overlay UI showing the run-complete state, combat summary area, replay controls, run-log action, growth action, and return-to-hub loop.
- All runtime values are public-safe seeded state, not real player telemetry.
- No source project files under ~/workspace/reference-projects or D:/workspace4Codex/intespace were modified.

| Route | Viewport | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| /cases/godot-showcase | 1440x900 and 390x844 | pass | Case route loads 20 images. intespace-result-summary.png decodes at natural size 540x960 after lazy-load scroll; no console errors, no failed requests, no horizontal overflow, no non-product positioning wording. |

## Commands Run

| Command | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Godot 4.6.1 capture runner | pass | Captured actual end overlay UI from `game_root.gd` at 540x960 by calling `_finish_run(true)` with seeded state. |
| file public/images/projects/showcase/intespace-result-summary.png | pass | Confirmed PNG file is 540 x 960, 75K. |
| npm run lint | pass | ESLint completed without errors in WSL. |
| npm run build | pass | TypeScript and Vite build completed in WSL. Existing lottie-web direct eval warning remains from dependency code. |
| sensitive/public wording scan | reviewed | No accounts, endpoints, credentials, IPs, or private configs found. Detail text describes public-safe seeded state. |
| Playwright QA with Windows Chrome | pass | Verified /cases/godot-showcase at desktop and mobile widths against the WSL dev server. |

## Public-Safety Review

- The selected screenshot shows only InteSpace result overlay UI with public-safe seeded runtime state.
- The capture was generated from seeded time, score, level, kills, damage, healing, revives, experience, upgrades, and meta/protocol progress.
- The values are seeded demonstration state for public-safe UI capture; they are not presented as raw player telemetry, real user data, or production logs.
- No local paths, accounts, tokens, IPs, domains, logs, release package names, Godot .import metadata, export packages, hashes, or generated validation output were published.
- The temporary compatibility method and capture scripts remain in the temporary capture directory and were not copied into the site or source project.
- InteSpace now has player hub, gameplay HUD, result summary, and system loop diagram evidence; the result-page gap is closed.

## Ship Decision

Ready to commit and push after final git diff review.
