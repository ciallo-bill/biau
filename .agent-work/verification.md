Task: Add xunqiu migration and verification evidence

## Diff Summary

- `public/images/projects/showcase/xunqiu-module-map.svg`: added a public-safe 64-bit client module map.
- `public/images/projects/showcase/xunqiu-migration-flow.svg`: added a public-safe migration flow diagram.
- `public/images/projects/showcase/xunqiu-verification-chain.svg`: added a public-safe validation chain diagram.
- `src/data/portfolio.ts`: promoted xunqiu to a key project and added the module-map visual.
- `src/App.tsx`: added xunqiu case image mapping and aligned evidence labels/details with the new diagrams.
- `docs/showcase-assets.md`: updated xunqiu asset coverage and remaining screenshot gap.
- `.agent-work/current-task.md`: marked the xunqiu acceptance criteria complete after verification.

## Windows / WSL Check

- Windows worktree `D:\workspace4Codex\blog-semi` has no useful uncommitted content to migrate.
- WSL Git sees the Windows-mounted copy as modified only because of CRLF/LF differences; `git diff --ignore-cr-at-eol --ignore-space-at-eol` is empty for the checked files.
- WSL `~/workspace/blog-semi` is the active repo and is newer than the Windows copy. Continue all implementation from WSL.

## Commands Run

| Command | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `npm run lint` | pass | ESLint completed without errors in WSL. |
| `npm run build` | pass | TypeScript and Vite build completed in WSL. Existing `lottie-web` direct eval warning remains. |
| `rg -n -e "面试" -e "作品集" -e "123\." -e "120\." -e "password" -e "密码" -e "账号" -e "IP" -e "token" src docs public .agent-work/current-task.md .agent-work/verification.md` | reviewed | Hits are public-safety guardrails, CSS numeric false positives, SVG coordinates, or existing desensitization notes; no real account, endpoint, credential, database URL, host, or interview/portfolio wording was introduced. |

## Deployment QA

- Commit pushed: `38559c0 Add xunqiu showcase evidence`.
- Cloudflare deployment refreshed after push. Initial asset checks returned the app shell, then changed to the new SVG assets after the build completed.
- Direct asset checks:
  - `/images/projects/showcase/xunqiu-module-map.svg`: `200`, `image/svg+xml`, `5276` bytes.
  - `/images/projects/showcase/xunqiu-migration-flow.svg`: `200`, `image/svg+xml`, `4843` bytes.
  - `/images/projects/showcase/xunqiu-verification-chain.svg`: `200`, `image/svg+xml`, `4672` bytes.
- Online browser QA with Chrome:
  - `/projects/xunqiu`: desktop and mobile load the module-map SVG at `1440x810`, with no console errors and no horizontal overflow.
  - `/cases/xunqiu`: desktop and mobile load all three xunqiu SVGs at `1440x810`, with no console errors and no horizontal overflow.

## Public-Safety Review

- The new xunqiu SVGs use concept-level labels only.
- They do not include real IPs, domains, accounts, tokens, package hashes, signing files, database config, SQL files, media URLs, server paths, device logs, or release package details.
- The diagrams explain module boundaries, migration stages, and validation evidence without copying sensitive content from `~/workspace/reference-projects`.
- `~/workspace/reference-projects` remained read-only.

## Remaining Work

- Later add real 64-bit client screenshots only after manual review, cropping, and desensitization.

## Ship Decision

Committed, pushed, deployed, and verified online.
